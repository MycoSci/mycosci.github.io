# Dacrymycetes <Badge variant="note" text="Class" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Dacrymycetes

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Class  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Dacrymyces stillatus_ (representing the type genus _Dacrymyces_)  
* **Authority & year:** Oberwinkler, 1990  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gelatinous to rubbery fruitbodies, yellow to orange coloration, tuning fork basidia, saprotrophic on wood  

## Discovery & Naming
The class **Dacrymycetes** was established by **Franz Oberwinkler** in 1990 to accommodate a distinct group of jelly fungi characterized by their yellow pigmentation and unique basidial structures. The name comes from _Dacrymyces_, meaning "tear fungus" (Greek _dakryon_ = "tear"), due to the typical shape of their fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Dacrymycetes** fungi are easy to recognize by their bright color and gelatinous consistency:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are gelatinous, rubbery, or soft-waxy in texture.
  - Forms vary: cushion-shaped, lobed, cerebriform (brain-like), or disc-shaped.
  - Colors are bright yellow to deep orange, rarely pale or whitish.
  - Often found growing directly on dead wood.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are unique: bifurcate ("tuning fork"-shaped) instead of the usual clavate form.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, usually ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include tuning fork basidia, gelatinous textures, and bright yellow-orange pigmentation.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, SSU) show that **Dacrymycetes** forms a distinct, early-diverging lineage within Basidiomycota, separate from other jelly fungi like Tremellomycetes.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Basidiomycota
 ├── Tremellomycetes
 ├── Agaricomycetes
 └── Dacrymycetes
```
The class likely represents an ancient branch adapted for efficient wood decomposition in moist environments.

Major orders:

- _Dacrymycetales_ (the primary and currently recognized order)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead wood, branches, stumps, and fallen logs; particularly in moist forest environments.
- **Substrates:** Primarily decaying wood of hardwoods and conifers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, specializing in early-stage wood decay (white rot).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across temperate, tropical, and boreal regions.

Species fruit mainly in wet, humid conditions, often appearing after rain.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Dacrymycetes** fungi are important forest recyclers:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not typically consumed — fruitbodies are gelatinous and small, though non-toxic.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Essential decomposers aiding in the early breakdown of dead wood and returning nutrients to forest soils.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their unusual tuning fork basidia and their evolutionary divergence from other basidiomycetes.
  - Interest in their enzymes for potential applications in biotechnology (e.g., wood breakdown processes).

Their bright colors, delicate textures, and vital role in early wood decay stages make _Dacrymycetes_ a distinctive and ecologically significant fungal class.
