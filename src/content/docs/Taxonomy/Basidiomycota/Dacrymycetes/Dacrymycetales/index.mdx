# Dacrymycetales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Dacrymycetes › **Order:** Dacrymycetales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Dacrymyces stillatus_ (representing the type genus _Dacrymyces_)  
* **Authority & year:** Bref., 1888  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Yellow to orange gelatinous fungi, tuning fork basidia, saprotrophic wood decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Dacrymycetales** was established by **Julius Oscar Brefeld** in 1888 based on the distinctive gelatinous fungi now classified within the Dacrymycetes. The name is derived from _Dacrymyces_, meaning "tear fungus," alluding to the small, droplet-shaped fruitbodies common among the group.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Dacrymycetales** fungi are recognized by their color, texture, and unique basidia:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are gelatinous to rubbery, with various forms: cushion-like, lobed, cerebriform (brain-like), or small disc-shaped.
  - Colors are predominantly bright yellow to deep orange.
  - Surfaces are smooth, wrinkled, or lobed.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are bifurcate (tuning fork-shaped), splitting into two sterigmata (spore-bearing arms).
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include yellow-orange pigmentation, tuning fork basidia, and gelatinous textures.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, SSU) consistently place **Dacrymycetales** as a monophyletic group within the early-diverging class Dacrymycetes.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

The order represents an ancient lineage of saprotrophic fungi specialized for moist wood decomposition.

Major families:

- _Dacrymycetaceae_ (the primary family encompassing most species)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist, decaying wood in forests, gardens, and woodlands.
- **Substrates:** Fallen branches, stumps, logs (especially hardwoods and conifers).
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, specializing in early-stage white rot.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found across temperate, tropical, and boreal regions.

Species often fruit abundantly after rain and are short-lived but rapidly growing.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Dacrymycetales** fungi are ecologically important but not widely known outside mycology:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not typically consumed — fruitbodies are gelatinous and too small, though harmless.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key decomposers initiating the breakdown of dead wood, softening it for colonization by other fungi and invertebrates.
  - Contribute to early forest nutrient cycling.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their unique basidial structure and their evolutionary position among early-diverging basidiomycetes.

Their bright color, jelly-like bodies, and essential forest recycling roles make _Dacrymycetales_ an intriguing and ecologically vital fungal order.
