## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sebacina incrustans_  
* **Authority & year:** Tul. & C. Tul., 1845  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Waxy to gelatinous crust fungi, smooth to wrinkled surfaces, broad symbiotic and saprotrophic roles  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Sebacina** was described by **Louis René Tulasne** and **Charles Tulasne** in 1845. The name derives from Latin _sebaceus_ ("greasy" or "waxy"), reflecting the shiny, waxy consistency of many species' fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sebacina** species are inconspicuous but ecologically versatile:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are resupinate (crust-like), gelatinous to waxy, often thin and smooth.
  - Surfaces are cream, white, yellowish, or pinkish; textures range from smooth to slightly wrinkled.
  - Fruitbodies can be widespread patches or small, scattered colonies.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are septate (internally divided), a rare trait among basidiomycetes.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, broadly ellipsoid to globose.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include septate basidia, waxy to gelatinous fruitbodies, and versatile ecological roles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Sebacina** as the core genus of the Sebacinaceae family in Sebacinales. Species within _Sebacina_ form a vital link in forest ecosystems through diverse symbiotic strategies.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

The genus shows remarkable ecological flexibility, including saprotrophy, ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, ericoid mycorrhizae, orchid mycorrhizae, and endophytism.

Important species include:

- _Sebacina incrustans_
- _Sebacina vermifera_ (notable for orchid symbiosis)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, humus-rich soils, leaf litter, moss beds, tree roots.
- **Substrates:** Soil, decomposing organic matter, living roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal, orchid mycorrhizal, and endophytic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widely distributed in temperate, tropical, and boreal ecosystems.

Species often fruit during moist seasons and are best seen after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sebacina** fungi are vital yet rarely noticed contributors to ecosystems:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not considered edible — fruitbodies are thin, gelatinous, and too small.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Form symbiotic partnerships with a wide range of plants, including trees, grasses, and orchids.
  - Help enhance nutrient uptake, drought resistance, and forest resilience.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their roles in plant-fungal symbioses.
  - Important models for understanding the early evolution of mutualisms in fungi.

Their hidden lifestyles, flexible symbioses, and fundamental importance to plant communities make _Sebacina_ one of the most fascinating genera among fungi.
