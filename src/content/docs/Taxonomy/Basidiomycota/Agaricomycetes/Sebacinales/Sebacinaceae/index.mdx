# Sebacinaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Sebacinales › **Family:** Sebacinaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sebacina incrustans_ (for the type genus _Sebacina_)  
* **Authority & year:** Oberwinkler, 1994  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gelatinous to waxy crust fungi, septate basidia, broad ecological roles (saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, endophytic)  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Sebacinaceae** was established by **Franz Oberwinkler** in 1994 alongside the creation of the Sebacinales. It is named after the type genus _Sebacina_, referring to the greasy or waxy appearance of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sebacinaceae** fungi are diverse, subtle, and widespread:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are resupinate (crust-like), brain-like, or occasionally club-shaped.
  - Textures range from gelatinous to waxy and rubbery.
  - Surfaces are smooth, wrinkled, or slightly lobed; colors include white, cream, yellowish, or pinkish.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are septate (divided internally), a rare feature among Basidiomycetes.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and globose to broadly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include septate basidia, gelatinous or waxy fruitbodies, and a broad symbiotic spectrum.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb1) place **Sebacinaceae** at the core of Sebacinales. Their evolutionary history shows remarkable flexibility, shifting between saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal, orchid mycorrhizal, and endophytic lifestyles.

This family exemplifies one of the most flexible ecological radiations among fungi.

Major genera:

- _Sebacina_ (type genus)
- _Tremellodendropsis_
- _Efibulobasidium_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Soil, leaf litter, mossy forest floors, tree roots, deadwood surfaces.
- **Substrates:** Dead organic material or live plant tissues (in symbiotic relationships).
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal, orchid mycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal, endophytic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; distributed in forests, grasslands, wetlands, and tropical ecosystems worldwide.

Species fruit inconspicuously during moist seasons, often blending into forest litter.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sebacinaceae** fungi are ecologically vital but largely invisible to the general public:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not considered edible — fruitbodies are small, gelatinous, and too subtle.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Crucial for plant nutrient uptake through mycorrhizal associations with trees, shrubs, and orchids.
  - Important agents of forest floor decomposition and soil structure maintenance.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their extraordinary symbiotic plasticity and early-diverging position among Agaricomycetes.
  - Increasingly recognized in agricultural science for potential in promoting plant health.

Their quiet presence, profound ecological flexibility, and evolutionary significance make _Sebacinaceae_ one of the most fascinating and underappreciated fungal families.
