# Sebacinales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Sebacinales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sebacina incrustans_ (representing the type genus _Sebacina_)  
* **Authority & year:** Oberwinkler, 1994  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gelatinous to waxy fruitbodies, smooth to warted surfaces, diverse mycorrhizal and endophytic symbionts  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Sebacinales** was established by **Franz Oberwinkler** in 1994 following molecular evidence that separated these fungi from traditional jelly fungi and crusts. It is named after the type genus _Sebacina_, which means "sebaceous" (waxy or greasy), describing the texture of many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sebacinales** fungi are diverse but share some key features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are resupinate (crust-like), gelatinous, waxy, or cerebriform (brain-like).
  - Colors are typically pale—white, cream, pinkish, or yellowish.
  - Hymenophores are smooth, wrinkled, or sometimes warted.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are often septate (divided by walls), unlike most typical basidiomycetes.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid to globose.
  - Clamp connections are usually absent.

**Synapomorphies** include septate basidia, gelatinous to waxy fruitbodies, and an extremely wide ecological breadth.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) reveal **Sebacinales** as a deeply diverging lineage within Agaricomycetes, separate from other jelly-like fungi such as Tremellales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricomycetes
 ├── Tremellales
 ├── Dacrymycetales
 └── Sebacinales
```
The order showcases remarkable ecological versatility and ancient divergence.

Major families:

- _Sebacinaceae_ (primary family of the order)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest litter, wood, moss, soil, and even living plant roots.
- **Substrates:** Soil, decaying wood, live roots, and stems.
- **Trophic modes:** Extremely versatile — saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal, endophytic, or even orchid mycorrhizal.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across forests, grasslands, and wetlands globally.

Species fruit mostly during moist periods and are often inconspicuous due to their small, thin fruitbodies.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sebacinales** fungi are ecologically important but little known to the public:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are gelatinous, thin, and often ephemeral.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Crucial players in nutrient cycling through various symbiotic relationships.
  - _Sebacina_ species form essential mycorrhizal associations with orchids, forest trees, and grasses.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied intensively for their evolutionary flexibility and broad symbiotic capabilities.
  - Important in understanding early evolution of plant-fungal mutualisms.

Their hidden but profound ecological roles, unusual basidia, and versatile life strategies make _Sebacinales_ one of the most fascinating and unique fungal orders.
