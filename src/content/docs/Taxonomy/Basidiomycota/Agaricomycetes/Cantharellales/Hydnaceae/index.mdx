## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hydnum repandum_ (for the type genus _Hydnum_)  
* **Authority & year:** Fries, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Tooth fungi (spines instead of gills), fleshy fruitbodies, white to orange tones, white spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Hydnaceae** was formally recognized by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1821. It is named after the genus _Hydnum_, which refers to the distinctive spiny (tooth-like) hymenophore instead of gills or pores — an unusual but ancient fungal trait.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hydnaceae** fungi are distinguished by their toothed or spiny undersurfaces:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are fleshy, cap-and-stipe mushrooms with hanging spines ("teeth") on the underside instead of gills.
  - Caps are convex to flat, smooth or slightly cracked, colored white, pale yellow, orange, or apricot.
  - Stipes are central, thick, and usually colored similarly to the cap.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, globose to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are often absent.

**Synapomorphies** include the presence of soft, fleshy spines instead of gills, white spore prints, and ectomycorrhizal lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Hydnaceae** as a distinct, early-diverging lineage within Cantharellales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Cantharellales
 ├── Cantharellaceae
 ├── Hydnaceae
 └── Others
```
The family likely represents a lineage maintaining primitive "toothed" structures as an effective spore dispersal adaptation.

Major genera:

- _Hydnum_ (the best-known "hedgehog mushrooms")

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Broadleaf and coniferous forests; often in mossy areas, among leaf litter or humus-rich soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil, closely associated with tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, exchanging nutrients with hardwoods and conifers.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread in temperate and boreal zones of North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species fruit during late summer and autumn, often in fairy rings or scattered groups.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hydnaceae** fungi are highly regarded both ecologically and gastronomically:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Hydnum repandum_ (wood hedgehog) and related species are **choice edible mushrooms**, prized for their nutty, sweet flavor and crunchy texture.
  - Often sautéed, grilled, or dried for later use.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important symbionts in forest ecosystems, supporting tree health and soil development.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for insights into early fungal evolution, spore dispersal mechanisms, and ectomycorrhizal functioning.

Their delightful textures, ecological importance, and culinary value make _Hydnaceae_ a unique and celebrated family among fungi.
