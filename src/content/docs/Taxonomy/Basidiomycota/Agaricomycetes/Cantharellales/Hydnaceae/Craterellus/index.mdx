# Craterellus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Cantharellales › **Family:** Hydnaceae › **Genus:** Craterellus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Craterellus cornucopioides_  
* **Authority & year:** Pers., 1825  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Funnel-shaped or hollow mushrooms, smooth to wrinkled undersurfaces, gray to blackish or yellow tones, white spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Craterellus** was formally described by **Christiaan Hendrik Persoon** in 1825. The name comes from Latin _crater_ ("bowl" or "cup") and the diminutive suffix _-ellus_, meaning "little cup," a direct reference to their hollow, funnel-like fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Craterellus** species are elegant and often subtle fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are trumpet- to funnel-shaped, often deeply hollow to the base of the stipe.
  - Hymenophores are smooth, veined, or slightly wrinkled — never true gills.
  - Colors range from dark gray, black, brown to bright yellow or orange depending on species.
  - Stipes are hollow, continuous with the cap, and similarly colored.
  - Spore prints are white to pale cream.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are often absent.

**Synapomorphies** include funnel-shaped hollow fruitbodies, smooth or veined undersurfaces, pale spore prints, and ectomycorrhizal lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Craterellus** close to _Cantharellus_ within the Cantharellales, but distinct based on morphology and genetic markers.

The genus likely represents an early-branching lineage specializing in nutrient-poor forest soils and mossy environments.

Important species include:

- _Craterellus cornucopioides_ (horn of plenty)
- _Craterellus tubaeformis_ (yellowfoot)
- _Craterellus ignicolor_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Mossy or leaf-littered forest floors, coniferous and mixed woodlands.
- **Substrates:** Soil, closely associated with the roots of ectomycorrhizal hosts (especially oaks, beeches, and conifers).
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, facilitating mutual nutrient exchange with trees.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread in Europe, North America, and Asia; rare reports from South America and Africa.

Species fruit during late summer and autumn, often in dense patches or hidden among moss and debris.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Craterellus** fungi are valued both culinarily and ecologically:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Craterellus cornucopioides_ and _C. tubaeformis_ are **highly prized edible mushrooms**, renowned for their rich, nutty flavors.
  - Popular in European and North American cuisines, often dried and rehydrated for use in soups and sauces.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Crucial mycorrhizal partners for many temperate forest trees, enhancing nutrient uptake and drought resistance.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for insights into ectomycorrhizal evolution, fungal biodiversity, and sustainable forest management.

Their understated beauty, delectable flavors, and critical ecological roles make _Craterellus_ a beloved genus for foragers and mycologists alike.
