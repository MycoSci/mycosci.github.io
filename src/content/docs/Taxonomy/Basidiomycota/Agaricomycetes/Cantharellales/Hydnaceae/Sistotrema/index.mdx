## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sistotrema confluens_  
* **Authority & year:** Fries, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Crust-like or resupinate fungi, smooth to slightly wrinkled surfaces, white to pale spore prints, diverse ecologies (saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal)  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Sistotrema** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1821. The name is derived from Greek _sistos_ ("woven" or "fabric") and _trema_ ("hole" or "opening"), referring to the often netted or porous microscopic structure of the hymenium.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sistotrema** species are quite diverse in form but share some structural traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are typically crust-like (resupinate) or thinly spreading patches; some species form small cap-like structures.
  - Surfaces can be smooth, cracked, or minutely wrinkled, colored white, cream, or pale gray.
  - Hymenophores may appear smooth, tuberculate (bumpy), or weakly toothed.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are often long and slender, sometimes multi-spored (up to six or more spores).
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are usually absent.

**Synapomorphies** include resupinate or weakly cap-like fruitbodies, smooth to weakly structured hymenophores, and pale spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Sistotrema** within the Cantharellales, but it is considered a polyphyletic genus — meaning it likely contains species from multiple evolutionary origins.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Cantharellales
 ├── Cantharellaceae
 ├── Hydnaceae
      ├── Hydnum
      ├── Clavulina
      └── Sistotrema (partly)
 └── Others
```
Some _Sistotrema_ species are closely allied with _Hydnaceae_, while others may belong to distinct families.

Important species include:

- _Sistotrema confluens_
- _Sistotrema brinkmannii_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests, woodlands, mossy soils, decaying logs, dead twigs, and bark.
- **Substrates:** Wood, soil, mosses, or leaf litter.
- **Trophic modes:** Both saprotrophic (decomposing wood or litter) and ectomycorrhizal with various trees and shrubs.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests.

Species often fruit in humid environments, forming thin, often inconspicuous patches.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sistotrema** fungi are mainly of ecological and scientific interest:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not considered edible due to their small, crust-like forms.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers of woody debris and soil litter, contributing to nutrient cycling.
  - Some species form ectomycorrhizal relationships, aiding in tree health.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for studying fungal diversification within early-diverging basidiomycete lineages.
  - Model organisms for exploring transitions between saprotrophic and mycorrhizal lifestyles.

Their understated presence, ecological importance, and intriguing evolutionary pathways make _Sistotrema_ a genus of quiet but critical significance.
