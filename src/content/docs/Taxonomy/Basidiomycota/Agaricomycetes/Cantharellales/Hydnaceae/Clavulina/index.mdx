## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Clavulina cristata_  
* **Authority & year:** (Holmsk.) J. Schröt., 1888  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Coral-like fungi, branched or simple club shapes, soft flesh, white to gray to purple tones, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Clavulina** was formalized by **Joseph Schröter** in 1888, refining earlier names by **Jens Wilken Hornemann**. The name comes from Latin _clavula_ ("little club"), referring to the club-like or branched forms of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Clavulina** species are distinctive coral-like fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are upright, either simple (club-shaped) or repeatedly branched, resembling miniature coral.
  - Colors range from white, gray, pale tan, to violet or purplish hues.
  - Surface is smooth to slightly rough, typically soft and fleshy when fresh.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are often two-spored, occasionally four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, subspherical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are generally absent.

**Synapomorphies** include coral-like or branched fruitbodies, white spore prints, and soft textures.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Clavulina** within the Cantharellales, closely related to _Hydnum_ and _Cantharellus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Cantharellales
 ├── Cantharellaceae
 ├── Hydnaceae
      └── Clavulina
 └── Others
```
The genus likely diversified early within the Cantharellales, maintaining coral-like forms as an adaptation to forest floor spore dispersal.

Important species include:

- _Clavulina cristata_ (crested coral fungus)
- _Clavulina cinerea_ (gray coral)
- _Clavulina amethystina_ (amethyst coral)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors of temperate, tropical, and boreal forests; among leaf litter and moss.
- **Substrates:** Soil; often near living tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Predominantly ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic partnerships with hardwood and conifer trees.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in woodlands across Europe, North America, Asia, and tropical regions.

Species often fruit in late summer and autumn after moist conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Clavulina** fungi are important both ecologically and for biodiversity:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Clavulina cristata_) are considered edible but generally not highly prized for flavor or texture.
  - They are usually collected locally rather than commercially.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Serve as important ectomycorrhizal symbionts, enhancing forest soil health and nutrient cycling.
  - Help maintain biodiversity among forest floor fungi.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for evolutionary transitions between coral-like and mushroom-like morphologies in basidiomycetes.

Their elegant branching forms, soft pastel colors, and quiet ecological importance make _Clavulina_ a charming and ecologically vital genus.
