**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Cantharellales › **Family:** Hydnaceae › **Genus:** Hydnum

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hydnum repandum_  
* **Authority & year:** L., 1753  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Fleshy mushrooms with spiny (toothed) undersurfaces, white to orange tones, white spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Hydnum** was described by **Carl Linnaeus** in 1753 in his landmark work _Species Plantarum_. The name _Hydnum_ derives from Greek _hydnon_ ("truffle" or "fungus lump"), originally referencing underground fungi but later used for fungi with spines instead of gills or pores.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hydnum** species are unmistakable among mushrooms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, sometimes irregular, dry or slightly moist, colored white, pale cream, orange, or apricot.
  - Hymenophores are composed of soft, down-pointing spines (teeth) rather than gills or pores.
  - Stipes are stout, usually centrally attached, matching or paler than the cap.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, globose to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are often absent.

**Synapomorphies** include fleshy bodies with soft spines, white spore prints, and ectomycorrhizal associations.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Hydnum** as a distinct and ancient lineage within Hydnaceae and Cantharellales, sister to gilled _Cantharellus_ and trumpet-shaped _Craterellus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

The genus likely represents a conserved adaptation to forest ecosystems, maintaining toothed structures for efficient spore dispersal.

Important species include:

- _Hydnum repandum_ (wood hedgehog)
- _Hydnum rufescens_ (orange hedgehog)
- _Hydnum albidum_ (white hedgehog)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Mixed hardwood and coniferous forests; mossy, acidic soils preferred.
- **Substrates:** Soil, closely associated with the roots of trees such as beech, oak, pine, and spruce.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, forming nutrient-exchanging partnerships with trees.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, North America, Asia); a few tropical species reported.

Species fruit in late summer and autumn, often forming fairy rings or dense patches.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hydnum** fungi are both beloved edibles and crucial ecological players:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Hydnum repandum_ and relatives are considered **choice edible mushrooms**, valued for their firm, crunchy texture and mild, nutty flavor.
  - Popular across Europe and North America, often sautéed or preserved.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important ectomycorrhizal symbionts, enhancing forest resilience and nutrient uptake for host trees.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Used as model systems for studies on ectomycorrhizal diversity and spore dispersal biology.

Their gentle spines, culinary value, and essential ecological roles make _Hydnum_ a beloved and vital genus in forest ecosystems and mycology.
