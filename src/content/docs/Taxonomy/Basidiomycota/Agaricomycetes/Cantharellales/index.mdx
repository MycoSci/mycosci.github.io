# Cantharellales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Cantharellales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Cantharellus cibarius_ (for the type genus _Cantharellus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Gäumann, 1926  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Fungi with smooth, ridged, or folded hymenophores; white to yellowish spore prints; many ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Cantharellales** was formally proposed by **Ernst Gäumann** in 1926. It is named after the type genus _Cantharellus_, the famous chanterelles. The name _Cantharellus_ comes from Greek _kantharos_ ("cup" or "goblet"), referring to the shape of the fruiting bodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Cantharellales** fungi are highly diverse but unified by several important features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies range from gilled mushrooms to coral-like forms and crust-like growths.
  - Hymenophores are often smooth, wrinkled, veined, or bluntly ridged rather than having true gills.
  - Colors vary widely, often white, yellow, orange, or pale.
  - Spore prints are typically white to pale yellowish.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, mostly four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are often absent or rare.

**Synapomorphies** include smooth to wrinkled hymenophores, pale spores, and often ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Cantharellales** as a distinct, early-diverging lineage within Agaricomycetes, separate from typical gilled mushroom orders like Agaricales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricomycetes
 ├── Agaricales
 ├── Boletales
 └── Cantharellales
```
The order includes fungi that evolved diverse morphologies, from cup-shaped fruitbodies (_Cantharellus_) to coral-like (_Clavulina_) and crust-like forms (_Botryobasidium_).

Major families:

- _Cantharellaceae_ (chanterelles)
- _Clavulinaceae_ (coral fungi)
- _Aphelariaceae_
- _Botryobasidiaceae_
- _Hydnaceae_ (tooth fungi)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, mossy soils, woodlands, tropical and temperate forests.
- **Substrates:** Soil, litter, wood, or mosses.
- **Trophic modes:** Predominantly ectomycorrhizal (e.g., _Cantharellus_), but also saprotrophic (_Botryobasidium_) and rare parasitic forms.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found on all continents except Antarctica.

Species fruit prolifically in warm, humid seasons but are also abundant in boreal and temperate zones.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Cantharellales** fungi are highly significant for human societies and ecosystems:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Cantharellus_ species (chanterelles) are among the most prized edible mushrooms worldwide.
  - _Clavulina_ species are sometimes edible but less valued.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical ectomycorrhizal partners for a wide variety of trees, supporting forest health, resilience, and nutrient cycling.

- **Economic value:**
  - Wild chanterelle harvesting is a major seasonal industry in Europe, North America, and Asia.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Models for studying early-diverging basidiomycete lineages, fungal ecology, and forest-mycorrhizal networks.

Their extraordinary diversity, delicious species, and crucial roles in forest ecosystems make _Cantharellales_ one of the most celebrated orders of fungi.
