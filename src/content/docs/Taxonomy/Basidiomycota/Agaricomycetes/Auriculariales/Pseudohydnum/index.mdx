# Pseudohydnum <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Auriculariales › **Family:** (historically placed within Auriculariaceae, often treated separately) › **Genus:** Pseudohydnum

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Pseudohydnum gelatinosum_  
* **Authority & year:** P. Karsten, 1868  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gelatinous fungi with spiny teeth-like projections (hydnoid surface), translucent to whitish fruitbodies, white spore prints  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Pseudohydnum** was described by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1868. The name means "false _Hydnum_," indicating its resemblance to true tooth fungi (_Hydnum_) while being structurally and phylogenetically distinct, especially due to its gelatinous texture.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Pseudohydnum** fungi are among the most visually distinctive of the Auriculariales:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are gelatinous, soft, and translucent to white or grayish.
  - Undersurfaces are covered with soft spines or teeth (hydnoid texture).
  - Shapes vary from lobed and irregular to cup- or ear-like.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are longitudinally septate (divided into compartments).
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are typically present.

**Synapomorphies** include a gelatinous, hydnoid fruitbody, septate basidia, and wood-decomposing behavior.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular studies (ITS, LSU) place **Pseudohydnum** within Auriculariales but somewhat distinct from typical _Auricularia_-like taxa. While sometimes historically placed within Auriculariaceae, some treatments place it closer to its own lineage within Auriculariales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Auriculariales
 ├── Auriculariaceae
 ├── Exidiaceae
 └── Pseudohydnum lineage
```
The genus likely represents a specialization toward decomposition in extremely moist or shady habitats.

Key species:

- _Pseudohydnum gelatinosum_ (the "jelly tooth")

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist coniferous and mixed forests, on fallen logs, stumps, and branches.
- **Substrates:** Dead conifer wood, occasionally hardwoods.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing lignified wood.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread in boreal and temperate zones across North America, Europe, and Asia; also found at high elevations in tropical areas.

Species often fruit in cool, damp seasons and environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Pseudohydnum** fungi are modest but ecologically notable:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Pseudohydnum gelatinosum_ is considered **edible** in some regions, often described as tasteless but prized for its crunchy texture.
  - Typically eaten raw or lightly cooked in salads or soups, especially in parts of Asia and Eastern Europe.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important decomposers in forest ecosystems, aiding the breakdown of fallen wood and promoting nutrient cycling.

- **Scientific and cultural relevance:**
  - Appreciated for its unusual jelly-like structure and tooth-like hymenium.
  - Occasionally featured in mushroom foraging guides as an oddity or edible curiosity.

Their alien, gelatinous textures and ecological importance make _Pseudohydnum_ a fascinating member of the Auriculariales.
