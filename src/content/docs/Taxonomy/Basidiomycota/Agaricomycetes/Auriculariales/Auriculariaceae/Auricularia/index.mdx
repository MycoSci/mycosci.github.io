**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Auriculariales › **Family:** Auriculariaceae › **Genus:** Auricularia

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Auricularia auricula-judae_  
* **Authority & year:** Bull., 1789  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gelatinous ear- or bracket-shaped mushrooms, septate basidia, saprotrophic, white spore prints  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Auricularia** was established by **Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard** in 1789. The name derives from Latin _auricula_ ("little ear"), referencing the ear-like shape of the fruiting bodies, particularly evident in species like _Auricularia auricula-judae_ ("Judas’s ear").

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Auricularia** species are unmistakable due to their unique structure and texture:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are gelatinous to rubbery, flexible, ear- or bracket-shaped, often lobed or wrinkled.
  - Colors vary from translucent gray to brown, reddish-brown, or black.
  - Surfaces can be smooth to finely hairy.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are longitudinally or obliquely septate, a hallmark feature.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to slightly allantoid (sausage-shaped).
  - Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.

**Synapomorphies** include gelatinous fruitbodies, longitudinally septate basidia, and saprotrophic wood-decomposing habits.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Auricularia** as the core genus within Auriculariaceae, distinct from jelly fungi in _Exidiaceae_ or _Tremellaceae_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Auriculariaceae
 └── Auricularia
```
The genus likely diversified early in basidiomycete evolution, adapting to humid wood-rich ecosystems.

Important species include:

- _Auricularia auricula-judae_ (wood ear)
- _Auricularia polytricha_ (cloud ear)
- _Auricularia cornea_ (smooth cloud ear)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Deadwood in moist forests, fallen branches, stumps, decaying trunks, especially in humid environments.
- **Substrates:** Hardwood (especially elder, oak, maple), occasionally softwoods.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing dead wood; some weakly parasitic behavior observed.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests worldwide.

Species fruit abundantly after rains and can persist across wet seasons.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Auricularia** fungi are extremely important both culturally and economically:

- **Edibility:**
  - Species like _A. auricula-judae_, _A. polytricha_, and _A. cornea_ are widely cultivated and consumed, especially in Chinese, Japanese, and Thai cuisines.
  - Valued for their crunchy texture, mild flavor, and versatility in stir-fries, soups, and salads.

- **Medicinal uses:**
  - Rich in polysaccharides with potential antioxidant, cholesterol-lowering, and immune-enhancing effects.
  - Used traditionally in Chinese medicine for respiratory health, blood circulation, and detoxification.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Critical decomposers in forests, helping to recycle nutrients from dead wood.

- **Commercial importance:**
  - Cultivated on logs, sawdust, and agricultural waste substrates.
  - A major sector of global mushroom production.

Their combination of culinary excellence, medicinal properties, ecological contributions, and resilience make _Auricularia_ one of the most celebrated fungal genera worldwide.
