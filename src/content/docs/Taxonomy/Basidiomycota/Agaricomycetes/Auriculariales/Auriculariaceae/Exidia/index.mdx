# Exidia <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Auriculariales › **Family:** Auriculariaceae › **Genus:** Exidia

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Exidia glandulosa_  
* **Authority & year:** Fr., 1822  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gelatinous wood-inhabiting fungi, black to brown or translucent masses, white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Exidia** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1822. The name comes from Latin _exido_ ("to exude" or "to ooze"), referring to the jelly-like, often moist appearance of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Exidia** species are classic examples of "jelly fungi," characterized by their amorphous and gelatinous textures:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are irregularly lobed, cushion-shaped, or brain-like, gelatinous when wet and rubbery or shriveled when dry.
  - Colors range from black, brown, purplish-black to translucent pale colors.
  - Surfaces may be smooth, wrinkled, or slightly lobed.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are longitudinally septate (divided internally), typical of Auriculariales.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include gelatinous fruitbodies, septate basidia, and saprotrophic lifestyles on wood.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) position **Exidia** within Auriculariaceae, though it has sometimes been allied with Exidiaceae in different taxonomic interpretations.

The genus likely evolved to specialize in decomposing dead wood in moist forest ecosystems, thriving in humid microclimates.

Important species include:

- _Exidia glandulosa_ (black witch's butter)
- _Exidia nigricans_ (warped witch's butter)
- _Exidia recisa_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead hardwoods, fallen branches, tree stumps, sometimes attached to standing dead trees.
- **Substrates:** Decaying wood, primarily hardwoods such as oak, beech, and maple.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, contributing to the decomposition of lignified plant materials.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in temperate and subtropical forests worldwide.

Species often appear prolifically after wet weather, reviving from a shriveled state during dry periods.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Exidia** fungi are modestly known but ecologically significant:

- **Edibility:**
  - Most _Exidia_ species are technically non-toxic but are not widely consumed due to tough texture and lack of substantial flavor.
  - Occasionally collected in small quantities, but culinary value is minimal compared to _Auricularia_.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important agents of wood decomposition, accelerating the breakdown of fallen timber and nutrient recycling.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - _Exidia glandulosa_ and _Exidia nigricans_ are known as "witch's butter" in folklore, associated with magical or superstitious interpretations of their sudden post-rain appearance.

Their tough, mysterious forms and importance in forest health make _Exidia_ an interesting and vital genus among jelly fungi.
