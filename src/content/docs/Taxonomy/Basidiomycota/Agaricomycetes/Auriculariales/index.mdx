# Auriculariales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Auriculariales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Auricularia auricula-judae_ (for the type genus _Auricularia_)  
* **Authority & year:** Gäumann, 1926  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gelatinous to rubbery basidiocarps, diverse forms (ear-shaped, crusts, corticioid), saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Auriculariales** was formally established by **Ernst Gäumann** in 1926. The name is derived from _Auricularia_, meaning "ear-like," referencing the typical shape of the fruiting bodies in many members of the group.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Auriculariales** species are morphologically diverse but unified by basidial structure:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies range from gelatinous (e.g., _Auricularia_) to leathery crusts (e.g., _Exidia_).
  - Shapes include ear-like, brain-like, resupinate (flat) forms, or wrinkled masses.
  - Colors vary widely: brown, black, gray, translucent, orange.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are unique: longitudinally or obliquely septate (divided internally).
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and vary from ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are generally present.

**Synapomorphies** include septate basidia, often gelatinous texture, and saprotrophic decomposition habits.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rDNA) show that **Auriculariales** is a distinct lineage within Agaricomycetes, separated from more typical gilled or bracket fungi.

Major families within Auriculariales include:

- _Auriculariaceae_ (ear fungi)
- _Exidiaceae_ (jelly fungi)
- _Hyaloriaceae_ (soft, translucent jelly fungi)

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricomycetes
 ├── Agaricales
 ├── Polyporales
 └── Auriculariales
      ├── Auriculariaceae
      ├── Exidiaceae
      └── Hyaloriaceae
```
The group likely diversified early in the evolution of jelly fungi, adapting to moist, wood-rich environments.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead wood, living tree bark, forest litter, humid microhabitats.
- **Substrates:** Primarily hardwoods, but also softwoods and occasionally dead herbaceous stems.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic; some weakly parasitic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; common in tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests worldwide.

Species often fruit after rains, especially in humid climates.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Auriculariales** fungi are important ecologically and culturally:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Auricularia auricula-judae_ (wood ear, black fungus) is widely cultivated and consumed, especially in East Asian cuisines.
  - Used in soups, stir-fries, and traditional medicinal preparations.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical decomposers of woody material, recycling nutrients and supporting forest health.

- **Medical and scientific relevance:**
  - _Auricularia_ species are studied for their bioactive polysaccharides with antioxidant, immune-boosting, and cholesterol-lowering properties.

Their gelatinous textures, fascinating life cycles, culinary value, and ecological roles make _Auriculariales_ a standout order among fungi.
