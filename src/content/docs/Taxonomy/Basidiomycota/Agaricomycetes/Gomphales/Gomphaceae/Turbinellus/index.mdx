# Turbinellus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Gomphales › **Family:** Gomphaceae › **Genus:** Turbinellus

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Turbinellus floccosus_  
* **Authority & year:** Earle ex Giachini, 2011  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Large funnel-shaped fungi, wrinkled or scaly caps, dry surfaces, brownish spore prints, mostly ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Turbinellus** was resurrected and validated by **Michael Giachini** in 2011 after molecular studies showed that species like _Gomphus floccosus_ were genetically distinct from other _Gomphus_ species. The name _Turbinellus_ comes from Latin _turbo_ ("spinning top") and _-ellus_ (diminutive), describing the twisting, funnel-like shape of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Turbinellus** fungi are large, striking mushrooms easily mistaken for chanterelles or pig’s ear fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are large, fleshy, vase- or funnel-shaped.
  - Caps are dry, often scaly or wrinkled, colored orange, reddish, or tawny.
  - Hymenophores are smooth to deeply wrinkled (not true gills).
  - Stipes are thick, continuous with the cap, often slightly narrowed at the base.
  - Spore prints are ochre to brownish.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth to slightly roughened, hyaline to pale yellow.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include large twisted funnel-shaped fruitbodies, brownish spore prints, and dry scaly or wrinkled caps.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) separate **Turbinellus** clearly from _Gomphus_ sensu stricto, placing it securely within Gomphaceae but closer to coralloid genera like _Ramaria_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Gomphaceae
 ├── Gomphus
 ├── Ramaria
 └── Turbinellus
```
The genus likely evolved adaptations for spore dispersal across forest floors in temperate and subtropical environments.

Important species include:

- _Turbinellus floccosus_ (scaly vase chanterelle)
- _Turbinellus kauffmanii_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous and mixed forests; commonly associated with pines, firs, and spruces.
- **Substrates:** Soil in humus-rich forest floors.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, exchanging nutrients with conifer roots.

- **Geographic range:** Mainly North America and Asia; especially abundant in western North America.

Species fruit during late summer and autumn, especially after rainfall.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Turbinellus** fungi are visually striking but require caution:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Turbinellus floccosus_ is considered **toxic** to some individuals, causing gastrointestinal distress; ingestion is not recommended.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Play important roles as ectomycorrhizal partners, enhancing nutrient uptake and resilience in forest ecosystems.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Models for understanding large-fruiting fungal adaptations and ectomycorrhizal diversity.

Their swirling forms, bold colors, and critical ecological partnerships make _Turbinellus_ one of the most spectacular and ecologically important genera of Gomphales.
