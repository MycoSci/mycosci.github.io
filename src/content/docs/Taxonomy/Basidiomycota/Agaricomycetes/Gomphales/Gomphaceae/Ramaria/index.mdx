**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Gomphales › **Family:** Gomphaceae › **Genus:** Ramaria

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Ramaria botrytis_  
* **Authority & year:** Fr., 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Coral-like fungi, highly branched fruitbodies, bright to pastel colors, white to ochre spore prints, saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Ramaria** was established by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1821. The name is derived from Latin _ramus_ ("branch"), a reference to the many-branched coral-like structure of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Ramaria** species are recognized for their extravagant coral-like forms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are erect, highly branched, coral-like structures.
  - Branch tips may be blunt, pointed, or even flattened, often colored differently than the main branches.
  - Colors range widely from white, yellow, orange, pink, violet, to brownish.
  - Flesh is often brittle, especially when dry.
  - Spore prints are white, yellowish, or ochre.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth to finely ornamented, hyaline to slightly yellowish.
  - Clamp connections may be present or absent depending on species.

**Synapomorphies** include branched fruitbody architecture, pastel or bright colorations, and white to ochre spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Ramaria** within the Gomphaceae family of Gomphales, although the genus is somewhat paraphyletic, with some lineages closer to _Gomphus_ and _Phaeoclavulina_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Gomphaceae
 ├── Gomphus
 ├── Phaeoclavulina
 └── Ramaria
```
The genus shows remarkable evolutionary radiation into different habitats and ecological roles.

Important species include:

- _Ramaria botrytis_ (cauliflower coral)
- _Ramaria formosa_ (beautiful coral — toxic)
- _Ramaria flava_ (yellow coral)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, often among moss, leaf litter, or grass; some prefer disturbed sites.
- **Substrates:** Soil, humus, or among decaying plant material.
- **Trophic modes:** Mostly ectomycorrhizal with forest trees; some species may be saprotrophic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across temperate and tropical forests worldwide.

Species often fruit during rainy seasons, sometimes appearing in fairy rings or dense patches.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Ramaria** fungi are ecologically and culturally significant:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Ramaria botrytis, R. flava_) are edible when young and properly identified.
  - Others (_e.g., Ramaria formosa_) are mildly toxic and can cause gastrointestinal distress — caution is essential.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Play important roles as decomposers and symbiotic partners in nutrient cycling.
  - Support healthy forest ecosystems through soil enrichment and mycorrhizal interactions.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for evolutionary diversification, coral-like morphogenesis, and mycorrhizal networks.

Their stunning forms, ecological versatility, and sometimes edible offerings make _Ramaria_ one of the most remarkable and colorful genera among forest fungi.
