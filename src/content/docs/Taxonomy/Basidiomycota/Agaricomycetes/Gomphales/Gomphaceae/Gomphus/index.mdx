# Gomphus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Gomphales › **Family:** Gomphaceae › **Genus:** Gomphus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Gomphus clavatus_  
* **Authority & year:** Pers., 1797  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Funnel- or vase-shaped fungi, wrinkled hymenophores, dry and often scaly caps, white to pale spore prints, saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Gomphus** was described by **Christiaan Hendrik Persoon** in 1797. The name comes from Greek _gomphos_ ("peg" or "nail"), referring to the robust, peg-like appearance of the fruitbodies in some species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Gomphus** fungi are robust, sculptural mushrooms often mistaken for chanterelles:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are typically large, vase- or funnel-shaped, with thick flesh.
  - Caps are dry, often wrinkled, scaly, or roughened.
  - Hymenophores are smooth to wrinkled, not true gills.
  - Colors range from purplish-brown to gray, orange, or yellow.
  - Spore prints are pale buff to light ochre.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth to finely ornamented, hyaline to slightly yellowish.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include thick-fleshed, dry, wrinkled fruitbodies, pale spore prints, and absence of true gills.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Gomphus** within the Gomphaceae, closely related to _Ramaria_-like coral fungi and other diverse members of Gomphales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Gomphales
 ├── Clavariadelphaceae
 └── Gomphaceae
      └── Gomphus
```
The genus represents an evolutionary experiment in funnel-shaped forms suited to efficient spore dispersal on the forest floor.

Important species include:

- _Gomphus clavatus_ (pig's ear)
- _Gomphus kauffmanii_
- _Gomphus floccosus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous and mixed forests, often among moss or thick leaf litter.
- **Substrates:** Soil or organic-rich forest floors.
- **Trophic modes:** Mostly ectomycorrhizal with trees (especially conifers); some species may show weak saprotrophic abilities.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread in temperate regions of Europe, North America, and Asia.

Species fruit mainly in late summer and autumn following moist conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Gomphus** fungi are admired for their sculptural beauty but are variable in edibility:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Gomphus clavatus_ (pig’s ear) is considered edible and was historically prized in Europe.
  - Other species (e.g., _Gomphus floccosus_) can cause gastrointestinal upset and should be avoided.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important symbionts in forest ecosystems, helping trees absorb nutrients and improving forest resilience.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for insights into fungal evolution, particularly in the transition between coral-like and mushroom-like forms.

Their massive size, sculptural appearance, and forest ecological roles make _Gomphus_ a memorable and important genus in mycology.
