# Gomphales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Gomphales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Gomphus clavatus_ (for the type genus _Gomphus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Jülich, 1981  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Coral-like, funnel-shaped, or club-shaped fungi, dry to fibrous textures, saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Gomphales** was formally described by **Walter Jülich** in 1981 based on molecular and morphological evidence separating certain coral-like and club-shaped fungi from other orders like Cantharellales. The name is derived from the type genus _Gomphus_, itself from Greek _gomphos_ ("nail" or "peg").

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Gomphales** fungi exhibit a range of unusual fruitbody forms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are coral-like, funnel-shaped, brain-like, or club-shaped.
  - Surfaces are dry, often finely scaly or fibrous.
  - Colors range from pale cream, ochre, pinkish to bright yellow or orange.
  - Hymenophores (fertile surfaces) are smooth to slightly wrinkled; true gills or pores are absent.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth to finely ornamented, hyaline to pale brown.
  - Clamp connections are variably present or absent depending on species.

**Synapomorphies** include dry-textured fruitbodies, absence of true gills or pores, diverse growth forms, and often ornamented spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Gomphales** as an independent order within Agaricomycetes, distinct from coral fungi of the Russulales and Cantharellales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricomycetes
 ├── Cantharellales
 ├── Russulales
 ├── Gomphales
 └── Others
```
The order likely evolved in diverse terrestrial habitats, adapting to both saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal lifestyles.

Major families:

- _Gomphaceae_ (core family)
- _Clavariadelphaceae_ (larger club-shaped species)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, grassy woodlands, mossy soils, tropical forests, temperate woodlands.
- **Substrates:** Soil, humus-rich environments, occasionally decaying wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal with trees (_e.g.,_ _Gomphus_) or saprotrophic on decaying organic matter (_e.g.,_ some _Ramaria_ relatives).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found worldwide, especially in temperate and tropical forests.

Species often fruit in late summer to autumn, especially after rain.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Gomphales** fungi are valued for their biodiversity and complex ecological roles:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Gomphus clavatus_, the pig's ear mushroom) are edible and collected locally.
  - Caution is needed due to similarity to mildly toxic lookalikes.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important partners in forest nutrient cycles.
  - Key early decomposers or symbiotic partners depending on species.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for studies of fungal morphology evolution, particularly transitions between coral, club, and cup forms.
  - Provide insight into shifts between saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal lifestyles.

Their strange, sculptural forms, ecological variety, and evolutionary significance make _Gomphales_ one of the most fascinating and underappreciated fungal orders.
