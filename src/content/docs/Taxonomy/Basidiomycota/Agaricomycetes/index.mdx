# Agaricomycetes <Badge variant="note" text="Class" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Class  
* **Type species (if applicable):** N/A (Class-level; iconic genera include _Agaricus_, _Amanita_, _Ganoderma_, _Polyporus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Doweld, 2001 (based on molecular phylogenetics)  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Mushroom-forming fungi, basidiocarps with gills, pores, or teeth, complex life cycles, dominant in forest ecosystems  

## Discovery & Naming
The class **Agaricomycetes** was circumscribed by **Alexander Doweld** in 2001 to accommodate a large and diverse lineage of mushroom-forming fungi confirmed through molecular phylogenetic analyses. The name is derived from the type genus _Agaricus_, meaning "field fungus" in Latin, referencing early-cultivated edible mushrooms. Historically referred to as "Hymenomycetes" based on morphology, Agaricomycetes now reflects true evolutionary relationships.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Agaricomycetes** fungi are enormously diverse, but they share several key features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) range from mushrooms, shelf fungi (brackets), puffballs, stinkhorns, jelly fungi, to coral and tooth fungi.
  - Hymenophores (spore-producing surfaces) can be gilled, poroid, smooth, or toothed.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped cells producing basidiospores, usually four per basidium.
  - Basidiospores are highly variable—smooth to ornamented, pigmented or hyaline.

**Synapomorphies** include the production of basidiospores on external basidia and the development of often large, complex fruiting bodies.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2, TEF1) consistently recognize **Agaricomycetes** as a major monophyletic lineage within **Agaricomycotina**.

Major orders include:

- _Agaricales_ (typical gilled mushrooms)
- _Polyporales_ (bracket fungi and polypores)
- _Boletales_ (boletes and related species)
- _Russulales_ (brittlegills and milkcaps)
- _Cantharellales_ (chanterelles and allies)

The Agaricomycetes are ancient, with fossil evidence indicating origins over 250 million years ago, associated with the rise of complex forest ecosystems.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Primarily terrestrial — forests, grasslands, woodlands, tundras, and sometimes urban environments.
- **Substrates:** Soil, wood, litter, living trees, dung, occasionally parasitic on other fungi or animals.
- **Trophic modes:**
  - Saprotrophic (wood and litter decay).
  - Mycorrhizal (symbioses with plant roots).
  - Parasitic (on plants, insects, or other fungi).

- **Geographic range:** Global; abundant in tropical, subtropical, temperate, and arctic ecosystems.

Agaricomycetes fungi dominate terrestrial fungal biomass and are crucial for forest ecosystem function and nutrient cycling.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Agaricomycetes** fungi have major impacts on human societies and ecosystems:

- **Edible species:**
  - _Agaricus bisporus_ (button mushroom), _Pleurotus ostreatus_ (oyster mushroom), _Cantharellus cibarius_ (chanterelle).

- **Medicinal fungi:**
  - _Ganoderma lucidum_ (reishi) is used for immune modulation and traditional medicine.
  - _Lentinula edodes_ (shiitake) is valued for both nutrition and medicinal compounds like lentinan.

- **Wood decay and decomposition:**
  - Polypores like _Fomes fomentarius_ and _Trametes versicolor_ play critical roles in breaking down lignin and cycling carbon.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Mycorrhizal species (_Amanita_, _Boletus_, _Russula_) form vital mutualisms with forest trees, enhancing plant health and growth.

- **Cultural impact:**
  - Featured prominently in folklore, mythology, and modern media.
  - Some mushrooms, like _Amanita muscaria_, have psychoactive properties and rich ethnobotanical histories.

Their culinary, medicinal, ecological, and cultural significance make Agaricomycetes arguably the most famous class of fungi.
