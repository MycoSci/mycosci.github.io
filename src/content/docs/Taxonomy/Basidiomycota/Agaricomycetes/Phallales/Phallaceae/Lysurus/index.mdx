# Lysurus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Phallales › **Family:** Phallaceae › **Genus:** Lysurus

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lysurus mokusin_  
* **Authority & year:** Fr., 1823  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gasteroid fungi, upright finger-like arms, slimy gleba, bright coloration (orange, red, pink), insect-dispersed spores  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Lysurus** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1823. The name comes from Greek _lysis_ ("loosening" or "releasing") and _oura_ ("tail"), referring to the separate finger-like arms of the mature fruitbody that bear gleba to release spores.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lysurus** species are spectacular members of the stinkhorn family:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies arise from gelatinous "eggs" and rapidly expand into upright, multi-armed structures.
  - Arms are hollow, spongy, often triangular or polygonal in cross-section, brightly colored orange, pink, or reddish.
  - Gleba (slimy spore mass) coats the inner surfaces of the arms, emitting a foul odor to attract insects.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include upright spongy arms, slimy gleba, and insect-mediated spore dispersal.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Lysurus** as a distinct genus within Phallaceae, closely related to other bizarre fungi like _Clathrus_ and _Phallus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Phallaceae
 ├── Phallus
 ├── Clathrus
 └── Lysurus
```
The genus likely evolved to specialize in spore dispersal via flies and beetles in tropical and subtropical environments.

Important species include:

- _Lysurus mokusin_ (lantern stinkhorn)
- _Lysurus periphragmoides_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist soils, mulch, lawns, gardens, forest edges, and urban parks.
- **Substrates:** Organic-rich soils, compost piles, decaying plant matter.

- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing dead organic material.

- **Geographic range:** Tropical and subtropical regions worldwide; occasionally in temperate zones during warm, wet periods.

Species often fruit explosively after rains, growing rapidly from underground eggs.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lysurus** fungi are rare but striking ecological players:

- **Edibility:**
  - Immature "egg" stages may be edible in some cultures but mature fruitbodies are usually avoided due to their odor.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Effective decomposers of leaf litter and soil organic matter.
  - Important food sources for spore-dispersing insects.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Their bizarre forms and dramatic emergence make them popular subjects for photographers and naturalists.
  - In some folklore traditions, their rapid appearance is seen as a mystical event.

Their colorful, alien appearance, fascinating life cycles, and role in decomposition make _Lysurus_ one of the most visually remarkable genera of fungi.
