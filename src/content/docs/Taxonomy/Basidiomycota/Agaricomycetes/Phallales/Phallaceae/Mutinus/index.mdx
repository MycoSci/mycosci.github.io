# Mutinus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Phallales › **Family:** Phallaceae › **Genus:** Mutinus

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Mutinus caninus_  
* **Authority & year:** Fr., 1823  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Slender phallic fungi, slimy gleba at the tip, brightly colored stipes (red, pink, orange), saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Mutinus** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1823. The name refers to **Mutinus Titinus**, an ancient Roman fertility deity, a nod to the suggestive shape of the mature fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Mutinus** species are slender, vivid stinkhorns:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies emerge from gelatinous "eggs" and rapidly expand into slender, cylindrical columns.
  - Stipes are bright-colored (pink, red, orange), smooth, and often taper toward the apex.
  - Slimy gleba (spore mass) is restricted to the tip of the column.
  - Mature structures may collapse quickly after spore dispersal.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include narrow cylindrical fruitbodies, tip-restricted gleba, and brightly colored stipes.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Mutinus** firmly within Phallaceae, closely related to _Phallus_ and _Lysurus_ but differentiated by its slender morphology and gleba distribution.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

```
The genus evolved adaptations for insect-dispersed spore dispersal, specializing in saprotrophic niches rich in organic matter.

Important species include:

- _Mutinus caninus_ (dog stinkhorn)
- _Mutinus elegans_ (elegant stinkhorn)
- _Mutinus ravenelii_ (Ravenel’s stinkhorn)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest litter, gardens, compost heaps, mulch beds, grassy lawns.
- **Substrates:** Decomposing plant matter, rich soils, and wood chips.

- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, contributing to decomposition and soil enrichment.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found worldwide in temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions.

Species fruit quickly after rains, often appearing overnight.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Mutinus** fungi are curious but modest ecological contributors:

- **Edibility:**
  - Immature "egg" stages are sometimes consumed (rarely), but mature fruitbodies are avoided due to foul odor and unpalatable texture.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Act as decomposers, breaking down organic material and recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem.
  - Their insect-attracting strategy helps in efficient spore dispersal.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Notable for their curious, often humorous forms in folklore and popular nature writing.

Their slender elegance, rapid life cycle, and decomposer roles make _Mutinus_ an iconic member of the stinkhorn family.
