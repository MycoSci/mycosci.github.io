**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Phallales › **Family:** Phallaceae › **Genus:** Clathrus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Clathrus ruber_  
* **Authority & year:** Micheli ex L., 1753  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Lattice-like (cage or basket) fruitbodies, bright colors (red, orange), foul-smelling slimy gleba, insect-dispersed spores  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Clathrus** was described by **Pier Antonio Micheli**, formalized by **Carl Linnaeus** in 1753. The name _Clathrus_ is Latin for "lattice" or "trellis," reflecting the characteristic open, cage-like structure of the mature fruiting bodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Clathrus** species are among the most visually striking fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies emerge from gelatinous "eggs" and rapidly expand into latticed or cage-like structures.
  - Colors are often bright red, pink, orange, or scarlet.
  - Gleba (spore mass) coats the inner surfaces of the lattice with a foul-smelling, slimy substance.
  - The structure eventually collapses and decays after spore dispersal.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include cage- or basket-shaped fruitbodies, slime-covered gleba, and insect-mediated spore dispersal.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Clathrus** within Phallaceae, distinct from _Phallus_ (classic stinkhorns) but sharing the rapid fruitbody emergence and insect dispersal strategies.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Phallaceae
 ├── Phallus
 └── Clathrus
```
The genus likely evolved in warm, humid climates to exploit rapid spore dispersal using flies and other insects.

Important species include:

- _Clathrus ruber_ (the red cage fungus)
- _Clathrus archeri_ (devil's fingers — sometimes separated into _Aseroe_ or close relatives)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, gardens, mulch beds, sandy soils, and disturbed sites rich in organic matter.
- **Substrates:** Decomposing plant material, leaf litter, compost.

- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, aiding decomposition of organic matter.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan in warmer climates; most diverse in subtropical and tropical regions, but _C. ruber_ is found in Mediterranean areas, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of North America.

Species often fruit explosively after heavy rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Clathrus** fungi are beloved oddities of the fungal world:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — mature fruitbodies are foul-smelling and not palatable; immature "eggs" may be consumed in some cultures but with caution.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Efficient decomposers, aiding nutrient cycling in soils.
  - Provide food for insect communities attracted to the gleba.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Celebrated for their bizarre, beautiful forms; _Clathrus ruber_ is a favorite among nature photographers and naturalists.

Their shocking appearance, rapid growth, and ecological service in decomposition make _Clathrus_ one of the most unforgettable fungal genera.
