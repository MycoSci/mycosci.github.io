# Thelephorales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Thelephorales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Thelephora terrestris_ (representing the type genus _Thelephora_)  
* **Authority & year:** Gäumann, 1926  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Crust-like, fan-shaped, or coral-like fungi, tough textures, dark spore prints, ectomycorrhizal symbionts  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Thelephorales** was established by **Ernst Gäumann** in 1926. It is named after the type genus _Thelephora_, from Greek _thele_ ("nipple") and _phoros_ ("bearing"), referencing the small projections on some early observed species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Thelephorales** fungi are highly diverse in form but united by spore and ecological traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are typically crust-like (resupinate), coral-like (branched), or fan-shaped.
  - Surfaces are tough, leathery, or brittle.
  - Colors are usually dark: brown, gray, black, purple, or olive.
  - Hymenophores are smooth, wrinkled, veined, or sometimes slightly toothed.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are often unusual: thick-walled, sometimes with septa or multiple sterigmata.
  - Spores are ornamented, brown to blackish, typically echinulate (spiny) and often appear dark in mass.
  - Clamp connections are generally absent.

**Synapomorphies** include brown, ornamented spores, tough textures, and primary ectomycorrhizal ecology.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) support **Thelephorales** as a distinct lineage within Agaricomycetes, distinct from crust fungi in Russulales or Auriculariales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricomycetes
 ├── Polyporales
 ├── Russulales
 └── Thelephorales
```
The order represents an ancient lineage specializing in symbiosis and adaptation to poor, nutrient-deficient soils.

Major families:

- _Thelephoraceae_ (dominant family)
- _Tomentellaceae_ (primarily crust-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest soils, forest litter, occasionally on mossy wood or roots.
- **Substrates:** Soil and occasionally woody debris.
- **Trophic modes:** Predominantly ectomycorrhizal, partnering with trees, especially conifers and hardwoods.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; abundant in temperate, boreal, and tropical forests worldwide.

Species fruit prolifically during wet seasons but are often overlooked due to their low profiles and dark coloration.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Thelephorales** fungi are critically important but underappreciated:

- **Edibility:**
  - Generally not edible — fruitbodies are tough, leathery, and often bitter or acrid.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major ectomycorrhizal partners promoting forest health, tree nutrition, and ecosystem resilience.
  - Important in nutrient-poor soils where other mycorrhizal fungi are scarce.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their roles in forest nutrient dynamics, soil ecology, and fungal biodiversity.
  - Interest in their potential for sustainable forestry and reforestation projects.

Their dark beauty, hidden symbiotic lives, and crucial ecological roles make _Thelephorales_ a foundational fungal order in healthy forest ecosystems.
