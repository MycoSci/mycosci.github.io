# Bankeraceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Thelephorales › **Family:** Bankeraceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hydnellum suaveolens_ (representing the family’s core morphology)  
* **Authority & year:** Maas Geest., 1961  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Toothed fungi, tough fruitbodies, dark spore prints, ectomycorrhizal with trees  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Bankeraceae** was established by **Rudolf Arnold Maas Geesteranus** in 1961 to group certain tough, toothed fungi with dark spores, distinct from typical coral fungi and polypores. It is named in honor of **Howard James Banker**, an early 20th-century mycologist who specialized in tooth fungi.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Bankeraceae** fungi are specialized wood-associated symbionts:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are mushroom-shaped, often with caps and central stipes.
  - Undersurfaces are covered with spines (teeth) instead of gills or pores.
  - Cap surfaces are dry, rough, or scaly, often colored in browns, grays, blues, or reds.
  - Flesh is tough, fibrous, or corky.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are ornamented, brown to dark brown, and often strongly echinulate (spiny).
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include spiny hymenophores, tough textures, and dark, ornamented spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Bankeraceae** within Thelephorales, showing a close relationship to other dark-spored crust fungi but distinguished by their highly structured, toothed fruitbodies.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Thelephorales
 ├── Thelephoraceae
 └── Bankeraceae
```
The family evolved in tandem with the expansion of ectomycorrhizal forests, particularly coniferous ecosystems.

Major genera:

- _Hydnellum_
- _Sarcodon_
- _Phellodon_
- _Bankera_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Soil among moss, leaf litter, or near roots of living trees; frequently in coniferous forests.
- **Substrates:** Soil, often mossy or humus-rich layers.
- **Trophic modes:** Strictly ectomycorrhizal, forming mutualistic relationships with forest trees.

- **Geographic range:** Predominantly temperate and boreal forests across North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species are often rare or sporadic, sensitive to forest disturbance and soil compaction.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Bankeraceae** fungi are crucial for forest ecosystems and conservation:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are generally too tough and many species are bitter.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Vital ectomycorrhizal partners, promoting tree health, drought resistance, and nutrient cycling.
  - Indicators of old-growth forest health and soil quality.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Several species (_e.g., Hydnellum peckii, Phellodon tomentosus_) are threatened or protected due to habitat loss.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their role in forest ecosystem stability, fungal biodiversity, and mycorrhizal evolution.

Their beautiful spiny undersides, rich earth tones, and irreplaceable ecological roles make _Bankeraceae_ one of the most remarkable families in Thelephorales.
