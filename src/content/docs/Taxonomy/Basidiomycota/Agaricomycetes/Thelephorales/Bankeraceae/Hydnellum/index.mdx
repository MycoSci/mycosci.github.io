**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Thelephorales › **Family:** Bankeraceae › **Genus:** Hydnellum

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hydnellum suaveolens_  
* **Authority & year:** P. Karst., 1879  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Tough, spiny-toothed fungi, dark earthy colors, corky textures, ectomycorrhizal symbionts  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Hydnellum** was described by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1879. The name comes from Greek _hydnon_ ("truffle" or "tuber") and a diminutive suffix _-ellum_, hinting at the underground or ground-hugging habit of many species when mature.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hydnellum** species are distinctive among forest fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are centrally-stalked with cushion-like or cap-shaped tops.
  - Caps are dry, rough, sometimes cracked or zoned, with dark earthy tones (brown, gray, purple, blue, or black).
  - Undersurfaces are covered in downward-pointing spines (teeth) instead of gills or pores.
  - Flesh is tough to corky and often emits distinctive odors (e.g., sweet, fruity, or resinous).

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are ornamented, brownish in mass, and strongly echinulate (spiny).
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include dark, tough fruitbodies, spiny hymenophores, ornamented brown spores, and ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Hydnellum** within the Bankeraceae of Thelephorales, closely allied to genera like _Phellodon_ and _Sarcodon_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Bankeraceae
 ├── Hydnellum
 ├── Phellodon
 └── Sarcodon
```
The genus evolved specialized ectomycorrhizal relationships mainly with conifer trees in acidic forest soils.

Important species include:

- _Hydnellum suaveolens_ (sweet tooth)
- _Hydnellum peckii_ (bleeding tooth fungus)
- _Hydnellum ferrugineum_ (rusty tooth)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous and mixed forests, often on mossy, acidic soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil, sometimes in association with humus and moss layers.
- **Trophic modes:** Strictly ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiosis with pine, spruce, and fir trees.

- **Geographic range:** Temperate and boreal forests in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.

Species often fruit in late summer and autumn, sometimes forming large patches.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hydnellum** fungi are critical for conservation and forest health:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — most species are too tough, bitter, or unpalatable.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key symbionts aiding tree health and soil stability, especially in nutrient-poor environments.
  - Sensitive to disturbance; often used as indicators of old-growth forest integrity.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Many species (e.g., _Hydnellum peckii_, _H. suaveolens_) are rare or threatened and are protected in parts of Europe.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their ectomycorrhizal ecology, secondary metabolites, and role in forest biodiversity.

Their spiky elegance, hidden forest life, and critical ecological partnerships make _Hydnellum_ a truly remarkable genus within forest ecosystems.
