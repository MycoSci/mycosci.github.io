# Boletopsis <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Thelephorales › **Family:** Bankeraceae › **Genus:** Boletopsis

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Boletopsis leucomelaena_  
* **Authority & year:** Fayod, 1889  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Soft, bolete-like fungi with spiny to poroid undersurfaces, grayish to dark-colored caps, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Boletopsis** was described by **Victor Fayod** in 1889. The name combines _Boletus_ (bolete-like) and _opsis_ ("appearance"), indicating their superficial resemblance to true boletes despite different spore and ecological characteristics.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Boletopsis** species are unusual among tooth fungi for their bolete-like forms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are centrally-stalked, cap-and-stipe mushrooms.
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry, often grayish, brownish, or sooty black.
  - Hymenophores are poroid or finely toothed, located on the underside of the cap.
  - Flesh is firm but soft, white, and unchanging when bruised.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include soft, bolete-like forms, smooth spores, and ectomycorrhizal ecology.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Boletopsis** within the Bankeraceae of Thelephorales, sharing traits with other dark-spored ectomycorrhizal fungi despite their unusual cap-and-stipe morphology.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Bankeraceae
 ├── Hydnellum
 ├── Phellodon
 └── Boletopsis
```
The genus represents a fascinating convergence toward bolete-like forms within dark-spored lineages.

Important species include:

- _Boletopsis leucomelaena_ (gray false bolete)
- _Boletopsis grisea_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous and mixed forests, often in mossy or acidic soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil, typically near roots of pines, spruces, or firs.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with conifer trees.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across temperate forests of North America, Europe, and Asia, though generally rare.

Species often fruit in late summer and autumn, particularly after rain.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Boletopsis** fungi are ecologically important and of conservation interest:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species are edible when young, though they are not widely collected due to rarity and toughening with age.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important ectomycorrhizal partners supporting conifer forest health.
  - Serve as indicators of undisturbed, mature forest ecosystems.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Several species are considered rare or vulnerable due to habitat loss and forest fragmentation.

Their bolete-like appearance, mycorrhizal partnerships, and quiet ecological contributions make _Boletopsis_ a unique and valuable genus among forest fungi.
