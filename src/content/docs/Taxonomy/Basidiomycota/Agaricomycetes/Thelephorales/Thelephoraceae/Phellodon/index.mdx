**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Thelephorales › **Family:** Thelephoraceae › **Genus:** Phellodon

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Phellodon niger_  
* **Authority & year:** P. Karst., 1881  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Dark-colored, toothed fungi, tough corky textures, ectomycorrhizal with conifers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Phellodon** was described by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1881. The name is derived from Greek _phellos_ ("cork") and _odon_ ("tooth"), referring to the corky texture of the fruitbodies and the spiny (toothed) hymenophore.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Phellodon** species are small, hardy fungi with elegant simplicity:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are centrally-stalked, cap-and-stipe forms, typically solitary or scattered.
  - Caps are dry, rough, often zoned, and colored black, brown, gray, or bluish.
  - Undersurfaces are covered with short, dense spines (teeth) instead of gills or pores.
  - Flesh is corky to leathery.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are ornamented, brown in mass, and echinulate (spiny).
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include toothed hymenophores, corky textures, and dark, ornamented spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Phellodon** within Thelephoraceae of Thelephorales, closely related to other ectomycorrhizal dark-spored fungi like _Hydnellum_ and _Tomentella_.

Thelephoraceae
 ├── Phellodon
 ├── Hydnellum

The genus evolved adaptations for dry, nutrient-poor forest soils where symbiosis with conifers is advantageous.

Important species include:

- _Phellodon niger_ (black tooth)
- _Phellodon tomentosus_ (woolly tooth)
- _Phellodon atratus_ (sooty tooth)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous forests; mossy or humus-rich soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil, typically in close association with tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Strictly ectomycorrhizal, partnering with pines, spruces, and firs.

- **Geographic range:** Temperate and boreal forests of North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.

Species often fruit late in summer and autumn but can persist through colder seasons.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Phellodon** fungi are important forest symbionts and conservation indicators:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are too tough and bitter.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Essential ectomycorrhizal partners, aiding tree health, drought resistance, and forest resilience.
  - Indicators of ancient, undisturbed forests.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Many species are rare or declining due to habitat loss and are included in fungal red lists in parts of Europe.

Their tough, understated elegance, vital symbiotic relationships, and role as guardians of healthy forests make _Phellodon_ a quietly crucial genus among forest fungi.
