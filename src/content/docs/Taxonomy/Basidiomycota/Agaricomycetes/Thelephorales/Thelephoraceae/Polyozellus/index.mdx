## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Polyozellus multiplex_  
* **Authority & year:** Murrill, 1910  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Deeply lobed or clustered caps, dark blue to blackish colors, tough textures, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Polyozellus** was described by **William Alphonso Murrill** in 1910. The name combines Greek _poly-_ ("many") and _ozos_ ("branches"), referring to the highly lobed or clustered nature of its fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Polyozellus** species are visually striking and rare:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are composed of multiple lobed, spoon-shaped, or ear-like caps, arising from a common base.
  - Coloration is dark — deep blue, purple-black, or black when fresh, fading with age.
  - Undersurfaces are smooth to slightly veined.
  - Flesh is firm to leathery.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are brownish, ornamented, and often globose to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include dark fruitbody coloration, lobed structures, and ornamented dark spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Polyozellus** within Thelephoraceae of Thelephorales, closely related to other ectomycorrhizal fungi like _Thelephora_ and _Tomentella_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Thelephoraceae
 ├── Thelephora
 ├── Tomentella
 └── Polyozellus
```
The genus likely evolved in cold, nutrient-poor forest soils, forming tight ectomycorrhizal partnerships with conifers.

Important species include:

- _Polyozellus multiplex_ (blue chanterelle)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous forests, especially under spruce, fir, and hemlock.
- **Substrates:** Soil near tree roots, often in mossy or humus-rich ground.
- **Trophic modes:** Strictly ectomycorrhizal, supporting trees through nutrient exchange.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily found in North America and parts of Asia (e.g., Korea, Japan); rare or localized.

Species fruit in late summer to autumn, especially in moist, shaded environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Polyozellus** fungi are both ecologically significant and culturally revered:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Polyozellus multiplex_ is edible and considered a delicacy in parts of North America and Asia.
  - Valued for its rich flavor and firm texture.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key ectomycorrhizal partners enhancing tree health and forest stability.
  - Indicators of old-growth and undisturbed forest ecosystems.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, _Polyozellus multiplex_ is of conservation concern in some regions.

Their mysterious beauty, ecological value, and culinary appeal make _Polyozellus_ one of the most fascinating genera in temperate and boreal forests.
