# Thelephoraceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Thelephorales › **Family:** Thelephoraceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Thelephora terrestris_ (for the type genus _Thelephora_)  
* **Authority & year:** Chevall., 1826  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Crust-like to fan-shaped fungi, dark earthy colors, tough textures, ornamented dark spores, ectomycorrhizal symbionts  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Thelephoraceae** was established by **François Fulgis Chevallier** in 1826. It is named after the type genus _Thelephora_, combining Greek _thele_ ("nipple") and _phoros_ ("bearing"), referring to the nodular projections on some early-described species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Thelephoraceae** fungi are versatile in form but share key spore and ecological traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are crust-like (resupinate), fan-shaped, coral-like, or rosette-like.
  - Upper surfaces can be smooth, wrinkled, scaly, or fuzzy; colors are typically earthy — brown, black, gray, olive.
  - Hymenophores are smooth to wrinkled, rarely poroid or toothed.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are often thick-walled and septate (divided).
  - Spores are brown to blackish, ornamented (spiny or warty), and non-amyloid.
  - Clamp connections are usually absent.

**Synapomorphies** include dark ornamented spores, tough textures, and predominantly ectomycorrhizal lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Thelephoraceae** at the heart of Thelephorales, forming a diverse radiation of symbiotic fungi.

The family diversified significantly alongside the rise of coniferous and temperate broadleaf forests.

Major genera:

- _Thelephora_ (type genus)
- _Tomentella_
- _Tomentellopsis_
- _Polyozellus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest soils, humus layers, moss beds, sometimes decaying wood surfaces.
- **Substrates:** Soil, often associated closely with tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Strictly ectomycorrhizal, partnering with a wide range of trees and shrubs.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests worldwide.

Species tend to fruit during wet seasons but are often overlooked due to their low profiles and dull colors.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Thelephoraceae** fungi are ecologically vital but little known outside scientific circles:

- **Edibility:**
  - Generally not edible — fruitbodies are tough, thin, and often bitter.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major ectomycorrhizal partners, critical for tree nutrient uptake, drought resistance, and ecosystem health.
  - Important for soil structure and carbon cycling.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their diversity of ectomycorrhizal symbioses and roles in forest succession.
  - Species like _Thelephora terrestris_ are model organisms for reforestation and soil ecology studies.

Their humble appearances, immense ecological contributions, and widespread symbiotic networks make _Thelephoraceae_ one of the most foundational fungal families supporting global forests.
