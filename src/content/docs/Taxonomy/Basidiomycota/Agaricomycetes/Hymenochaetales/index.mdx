# Hymenochaetales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Hymenochaetales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hymenochaete rubiginosa_ (for the type genus _Hymenochaete_)  
* **Authority & year:** Oberwinkler, 1977  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Tough wood-decaying fungi, crust-like to bracket-shaped fruitbodies, brown rot or white rot agents, often with setae  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Hymenochaetales** was established by **Franz Oberwinkler** in 1977 based on distinctive structural features and DNA-based studies later confirmed it as a deeply diverging lineage of wood-decaying fungi. It is named after the genus _Hymenochaete_, meaning "membrane bristle" in Greek, referring to the bristly setae seen in many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hymenochaetales** fungi show great diversity in form but share common features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are typically resupinate (crust-like) to bracket-shaped (polypores) and are often tough or leathery.
  - Surfaces are smooth, cracked, or finely hairy, with some species bearing tiny bristles (setae).
  - Colors often include shades of brown, cinnamon, or black.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline to pale brown, ellipsoid.
  - Setae (thick-walled hair-like structures) are present in many species.
  - Clamp connections are often absent.

**Synapomorphies** include tough or leathery fruitbodies, presence of bristle-like setae, and lignocellulose decay abilities.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Hymenochaetales** as a distinct lineage within Agaricomycetes, separate from the traditional polypore and corticioid fungi groups.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricomycetes
 ├── Polyporales
 ├── Gloeophyllales
 ├── Hymenochaetales
 └── Others
```
The group is notable for independently evolving wood-decay mechanisms, including efficient white rot (degradation of both lignin and cellulose).

Major families:

- _Hymenochaetaceae_ (core family)
- _Schizoporaceae_ (sometimes included or closely allied)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead standing trees, fallen logs, stumps, and living trees (some species are parasitic).
- **Substrates:** Primarily wood (both hardwoods and softwoods).
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic (white rot and brown rot) and parasitic (causing tree diseases).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; particularly diverse in temperate and tropical forests worldwide.

Species can fruit year-round and persist for multiple seasons.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hymenochaetales** fungi are ecologically and economically significant:

- **Edibility:**
  - Generally **inedible** due to their tough, leathery textures and wood-decomposing roles.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Essential decomposers recycling wood in forest ecosystems.
  - Some species cause important tree diseases, notably heart rot in hardwoods (_Phellinus_ spp.).

- **Scientific and economic relevance:**
  - Model systems for studying fungal wood decay enzymes, particularly lignin degradation (white rot).
  - Significant for understanding carbon cycling and nutrient flow in forests.

Their hardiness, ability to decompose lignin, and wide ecological impact make _Hymenochaetales_ a critical order for forest health and fungal biodiversity.
