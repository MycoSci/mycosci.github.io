## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Trichaptum abietinum_  
* **Authority & year:** Murrill, 1904  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Thin, tough polypores, colorful pore surfaces (often lilac or purple-tinted), saprotrophic on dead wood  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Trichaptum** was described by **William Alphonso Murrill** in 1904. The name combines Greek _trichos_ ("hair") and _aptum_ ("fastened"), referencing the often hairy or fuzzy upper surfaces of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Trichaptum** species are among the more colorful wood decay fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are thin, bracket-shaped, or semi-resupinate (partly crust-like).
  - Caps are dry, zoned or fuzzy, usually grayish, brownish, or violet-tinged.
  - Pore surfaces are small-pored, sometimes appearing maze-like (daedaloid), and often lilac, violet, or purplish when fresh.
  - Flesh is thin, tough, and leathery.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are present.

**Synapomorphies** include thin, tough, hairy-topped fruitbodies, colorful pore surfaces, and brown rot wood decay.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Trichaptum** within the Hymenochaetales order, but its exact family-level placement remains uncertain (incertae sedis), though it is often considered closely related to Hymenochaetaceae.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Hymenochaetales
 ├── Hymenochaetaceae
 └── Trichaptum (incertae sedis)
```
The genus likely evolved to colonize exposed deadwood in a range of climatic zones, from temperate to boreal ecosystems.

Important species include:

- _Trichaptum abietinum_ (purple toothed polypore)
- _Trichaptum biforme_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead wood of conifers (_T. abietinum_) and hardwoods (_T. biforme_), logs, stumps, and fallen branches.
- **Substrates:** Primarily decaying wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing brown rot decay.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread; common throughout Europe, North America, and parts of Asia.

Species fruit abundantly year-round, often forming overlapping or layered groups on dead wood.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Trichaptum** fungi are important for biodiversity and forest recycling:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are too tough and leathery for consumption.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key decomposers of fallen trees, aiding in nutrient cycling and soil formation.
  - Help support invertebrate biodiversity (e.g., beetles, mites) that live in decaying wood.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Useful in studies of fungal community succession on deadwood and early brown rot decay.

Their delicate violet hues, important ecological role, and resilience make _Trichaptum_ a beautiful and vital genus in temperate and boreal forests.
