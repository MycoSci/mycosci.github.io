# Pseudoinonotus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Hymenochaetales › **Family:** Hymenochaetaceae › **Genus:** Pseudoinonotus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Pseudoinonotus dryadeus_  
* **Authority & year:** T. Wagner & M. Fisch., 2002  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Woody polypores, exuding amber liquid droplets ("weeping"), brownish pore surfaces, parasitic on hardwoods  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Pseudoinonotus** was described by **Thomas Wagner** and **Michael Fischer** in 2002 after molecular studies revealed that some species formerly placed in _Inonotus_ were genetically distinct. The name means "false Inonotus," reflecting the similarity in appearance but underlying phylogenetic differences.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Pseudoinonotus** species are tough, woody fungi with dramatic weeping behavior:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are perennial or long-lived, thick, bracket-shaped, and woody.
  - Surfaces are often cracked, rough, and colored brown, grayish-brown, or blackish.
  - Fresh fruitbodies frequently exude amber or brown liquid droplets ("guttation").
  - Pore surfaces are yellowish to cinnamon-brown, bruising darker with age.
  - Flesh is brownish, tough, and fibrous.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are thick-walled, pale brown, broadly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.
  - Setae (thick-walled bristle-like structures) are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include guttation (weeping liquid), thick woody fruitbodies, and brownish spores with no clamp connections.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) show that **Pseudoinonotus** forms a distinct clade within Hymenochaetaceae, separate from _Inonotus_ and _Phellinus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Hymenochaetaceae
 ├── Inonotus
 ├── Phellinus
 └── Pseudoinonotus
```
The genus likely represents a specialized adaptation to living hardwoods and specific environmental moisture conditions.

Important species include:

- _Pseudoinonotus dryadeus_ (weeping conk)
- _Pseudoinonotus nudus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Deciduous forests; particularly near oak trees and other hardwoods.
- **Substrates:** Living hardwood trunks and roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Parasitic on living trees (causing heart rot), occasionally continuing saprotrophic decay after the host dies.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily temperate zones in Europe and North America; also found in parts of Asia.

Species fruit in moist conditions and may persist on trees for many years.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Pseudoinonotus** fungi have major implications for forestry and tree health:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are extremely tough and fibrous.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key agents of heart rot in hardwood trees, significantly affecting tree stability and forest structure.
  - Serve as important habitat creators, producing cavities used by insects, birds, and mammals.

- **Scientific and economic relevance:**
  - Studied for their specialized lignin-degrading enzymes.
  - Important in arboriculture and urban forestry for assessing tree risk and decay.

Their dramatic weeping conks, hidden internal decay, and critical ecological impacts make _Pseudoinonotus_ one of the most fascinating genera of the Hymenochaetaceae.
