# Gloeophyllales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Gloeophyllales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Gloeophyllum sepiarium_ (for the type genus _Gloeophyllum_)  
* **Authority & year:** Thorn, Moncalvo, & Redhead, 2005  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Brown rot fungi, tough fruitbodies, often maze-like or gill-like hymenophores, wood-decaying  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Gloeophyllales** was proposed by **R.G. Thorn**, **Jean-Marc Moncalvo**, and **Scott A. Redhead** in 2005 based on molecular studies showing that _Gloeophyllum_ and its close relatives formed a distinct evolutionary lineage separate from other wood-rotting fungi. The name derives from the type genus _Gloeophyllum_, meaning "sticky leaf" in Greek, referencing the gelatinous nature of young fruitbodies in some species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Gloeophyllales** fungi are mainly recognized by their tough texture and unusual hymenophores:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are bracket-like (polypores) or resupinate (crust-like), tough and leathery.
  - Hymenophores may be poroid, gill-like, or maze-like (daedaloid).
  - Colors range from brown, orange-brown, to dark gray.
  - Often persistent and able to survive harsh, dry conditions.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include tough wood-decaying fruitbodies, maze-like hymenophores, and brown rot (decomposition of cellulose but not lignin).

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) support **Gloeophyllales** as a monophyletic lineage within Agaricomycetes, distinct from Polyporales and other polypore groups.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricomycetes
 ├── Polyporales
 ├── Gloeophyllales
 └── Others
```
The order represents a specialized adaptation for wood decay in exposed, dry environments such as standing dead trees or logging slash.

Major families:

- _Gloeophyllaceae_ (the main and defining family)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead standing trees, felled logs, wooden structures, fences, and other dry wood substrates.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead conifer wood; occasionally hardwood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, specializing in brown rot (selective cellulose decomposition).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; particularly common in temperate and boreal regions.

Species fruit mainly during dry seasons but can persist for extended periods due to their tough structure.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Gloeophyllales** fungi are ecologically and economically significant:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are tough, woody, and adapted for survival, not consumption.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key players in nutrient cycling, accelerating the breakdown of dead wood in forest ecosystems.
  - Their brown rot significantly alters wood structure and helps open forest canopies.

- **Economic impact:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Gloeophyllum trabeum_) are important in studies of wood decay and biodeterioration.
  - Cause structural damage to wooden buildings, fencing, and timber products.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Models for understanding brown rot enzymology, fungal resilience, and wood recycling.

Their survival in dry, harsh environments, crucial decomposition roles, and importance in forest health and wood management make _Gloeophyllales_ a uniquely impactful fungal order.
