## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Neolentinus lepideus_  
* **Authority & year:** Redhead & Ginns, 1985  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Tough-fleshed gilled fungi, serrated gill edges, brown rot decay, wood-inhabiting, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Neolentinus** was established by **Scott A. Redhead** and **James Ginns** in 1985. It was separated from _Lentinus_ based on tougher textures, brown rot-causing wood decay, and molecular data showing closer relations to _Gloeophyllum_ and other brown rot fungi. The name _Neolentinus_ means "new Lentinus," highlighting its historical connection.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Neolentinus** fungi resemble typical gilled mushrooms but are adapted for a woody lifestyle:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry to slightly scaly, colored whitish, tan, or brownish.
  - Gills are attached, often serrated (jagged) at the edges, and white to pale cream.
  - Stipes are thick, firm, centrally attached, and often deeply rooted into wood.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include tough, woody-textured fruitbodies, serrated gill edges, white spore prints, and brown rot-causing abilities.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Neolentinus** within Gloeophyllaceae, part of the Gloeophyllales order — showing that despite their gilled structure, they are more closely related to wood-decaying brown rot fungi than to typical agarics.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Gloeophyllaceae
 ├── Gloeophyllum
 └── Neolentinus
```
The genus likely evolved adaptations to dry, exposed wood environments alongside _Gloeophyllum_.

Important species include:

- _Neolentinus lepideus_ (scaly sawgill)
- _Neolentinus ponderosus_ (ponderosa pine sawgill)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead conifer and hardwood logs, standing dead trees, railway ties, and wooden structures.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dry, exposed wood, often on pine, spruce, and fir.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing brown rot (selective degradation of cellulose).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; especially common in temperate and boreal zones of North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species fruit throughout warm and dry seasons, persisting through droughts and extreme conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Neolentinus** fungi are important in forest ecology and wood science:

- **Edibility:**
  - Generally considered **inedible** due to tough texture and unpalatable consistency.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key decomposers of structural wood, aiding in forest turnover and deadwood recycling.
  - Play roles in breaking down old wooden structures (e.g., railway ties), impacting human-built environments.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Model organisms for studying brown rot enzymology, fungal adaptations to dry decay niches, and wood biodegradation.

Their sturdy fruitbodies, ecological necessity, and role in wood decomposition make _Neolentinus_ an essential genus bridging the worlds of gilled mushrooms and brown rot specialists.
