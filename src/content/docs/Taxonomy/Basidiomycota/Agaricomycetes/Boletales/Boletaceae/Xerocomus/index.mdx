**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Boletaceae › **Genus:** Xerocomus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Xerocomus subtomentosus_  
* **Authority & year:** Quél., 1887  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized boletes, dry often velvety caps, dull colors (brown, yellow, olive), brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Xerocomus** was formally described by **Lucien Quélet** in 1887. The name comes from Greek _xeros_ ("dry") and _komos_ ("hair"), referencing the dry, often finely hairy caps typical of species in this group.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Xerocomus** species are typical "soft boletes" with a few distinctive features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry, often velvety or finely tomentose, colored dull brown, tan, olive, or yellowish.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to olive, bruising blue or brown variably.
  - Stipes are slender to moderately thick, yellowish to brownish, sometimes slightly reticulate but often smooth.
  - Spore prints are olive-brown to brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, brown in deposit, ellipsoid to subfusiform.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include dry caps, brownish pore colors, soft flesh, and pale brown spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2) place **Xerocomus** as a distinct genus within Boletaceae, separate from _Boletus_, _Xerocomellus_, and _Butyriboletus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Xerocomellus
 ├── Xerocomus
 └── Butyriboletus
```
The genus likely evolved in temperate forests, forming ectomycorrhizal partnerships with oaks, pines, and other broadleaf trees.

Important species include:

- _Xerocomus subtomentosus_ (the suede bolete)
- _Xerocomus silwoodensis_
- _Xerocomus cisalpinus_ (previously placed in _Xerocomellus_)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Mixed forests, oak and pine woodlands, meadows near trees.
- **Substrates:** Soil in ectomycorrhizal association with trees.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across Europe, North America, and Asia; more restricted in the Southern Hemisphere.

Species typically fruit during summer and autumn after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Xerocomus** fungi are ecologically important but have modest culinary reputation:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Xerocomus subtomentosus_) are edible when young but often considered inferior due to soft flesh and mild or bland flavor.
  - Best used fresh as their texture deteriorates quickly after harvest.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Key partners for forest health, enhancing tree nutrient uptake and soil stability.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for understanding evolutionary diversification within soft-fleshed boletes and adaptation to different forest types.

Their humble appearance, ecological service, and evolutionary interest make _Xerocomus_ an essential genus among modern boletes.
