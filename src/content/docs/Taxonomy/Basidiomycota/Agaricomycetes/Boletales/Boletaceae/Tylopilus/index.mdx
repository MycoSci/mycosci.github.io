## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Tylopilus felleus_  
* **Authority & year:** P. Karsten, 1881  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium to large boletes, dry caps, pinkish to brown pore surfaces, brown spore prints, often bitter-tasting, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Tylopilus** was described by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1881. The name combines Greek _tylos_ ("knot" or "lump") and _pilus_ ("cap"), perhaps referencing the firm, fleshy caps typical of many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Tylopilus** species are recognized by their firm textures and often pinkish to brown pore surfaces:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry, often velvety or finely roughened, colored brown, tan, or reddish.
  - Pore surfaces are initially whitish or pinkish, becoming deeper pink to brownish with maturity; pores do not typically bruise blue.
  - Stipes are thick, central, often finely reticulated (netted) near the apex.
  - Spore prints are pinkish-brown to brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, brown in deposit, elongate to fusoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include pink-tinged pores, brown spore prints, dry caps, and firm flesh.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2) confirm **Tylopilus** as a distinct clade within Boletaceae, related to _Boletus_, _Leccinum_, and _Xerocomus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Leccinum
 ├── Tylopilus
 └── Others
```
The genus likely diversified alongside hardwood forests, particularly with oaks and beeches in the Northern Hemisphere.

Important species include:

- _Tylopilus felleus_ (bitter bolete)
- _Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus_ (purple-tinged bolete)
- _Tylopilus rubrobrunneus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Broadleaf and mixed forests; especially associated with oaks, beeches, birches, and pines.
- **Substrates:** Soil near ectomycorrhizal tree hosts.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, enhancing nutrient exchange with tree roots.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread in temperate zones across North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species typically fruit in late summer and autumn after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Tylopilus** fungi are important in forest ecology but have mixed culinary reputations:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species are edible (_e.g., Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus_), but many, like _T. felleus_, are intensely bitter and unpalatable.
  - Bitter species can ruin a mixed mushroom dish even in small quantities.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important symbionts for maintaining forest ecosystem health and resilience.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their evolutionary divergence from the true "porcini" _Boletus_ lineage.

Their firm, bitter nature, lovely colors, and vital ecological roles make _Tylopilus_ a genus well known to both foragers and forest ecologists.
