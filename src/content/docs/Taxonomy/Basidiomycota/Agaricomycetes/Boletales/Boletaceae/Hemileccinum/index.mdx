# Hemileccinum <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Boletaceae › **Genus:** Hemileccinum

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hemileccinum impolitum_  
* **Authority & year:** Šutara, 2008  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized boletes, dry to slightly sticky caps, yellowish pores, mild taste, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Hemileccinum** was described by **Josef Šutara** in 2008 following molecular studies that revealed certain species traditionally placed in _Boletus_ or _Leccinum_ were genetically distinct. The name combines _hemi-_ ("half" or "partial") and _Leccinum_, reflecting the partial resemblance to that genus.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hemileccinum** species show subtle but distinctive features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry to slightly tacky, smooth or finely velvety.
  - Colors vary from pale brown, tan, to olive.
  - Pore surfaces are yellowish to olive-yellow, sometimes slowly bruising brown (but not blue).
  - Stipes are stout, firm, often paler than the cap, sometimes faintly reticulated near the apex.
  - Spore prints are olive-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, olive-brown in deposit, narrowly ellipsoid to subfusiform.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include dry to slightly sticky caps, yellow pores without blue bruising, brown spore prints, and robust fruitbodies.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Hemileccinum** within the Boletaceae, distinct from core _Boletus_, _Leccinum_, and other related genera.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Hemileccinum
 ├── Leccinum
 └── Others
```
The genus likely evolved to specialize in ectomycorrhizal relationships with broadleaf trees in temperate and Mediterranean ecosystems.

Important species include:

- _Hemileccinum impolitum_ (iodine bolete)
- _Hemileccinum depilatum_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests and woodlands, often under oaks, beeches, and chestnuts.
- **Substrates:** Soil near living trees in ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, exchanging nutrients with tree roots.

- **Geographic range:** Mainly Europe and the Mediterranean basin; reports also extend into parts of Asia.

Species fruit in summer and autumn, typically after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hemileccinum** fungi are modestly important ecologically and gastronomically:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Hemileccinum impolitum_ is considered edible when properly cooked but is often avoided due to its strong iodine-like odor when fresh.
  - Other species are edible but rarely gathered.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important partners in temperate forest nutrient dynamics, aiding tree health and ecosystem stability.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Their reclassification demonstrates the power of molecular phylogenetics to resolve subtle distinctions among bolete-like fungi.

Their subtle beauty, ecological roles, and interesting odor make _Hemileccinum_ a genus of quiet importance in fungal diversity.
