## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Rubroboletus satanas_  
* **Authority & year:** Kuan Zhao & Zhu L. Yang, 2014  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium to large robust boletes, vivid red or pinkish tones, yellow pores often bruising blue, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Rubroboletus** was described by **Kuan Zhao** and **Zhu L. Yang** in 2014 following molecular reanalysis that split traditional _Boletus_ into several distinct lineages. The name combines Latin _rubro-_ ("red") and _Boletus_, referring to the characteristic bright reddish coloration of the cap, pores, or stipe.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Rubroboletus** species are among the most colorful and robust of all boletes:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly convex, dry to slightly velvety, often vivid red, pinkish, or reddish-brown.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to orange, bruising intensely blue when handled.
  - Stipes are thick, stout, often red or reddish with reticulations (net-like patterns).
  - Spore prints are olive-brown to brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, brown in deposit, ellipsoid to broadly fusiform.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include strong red pigmentation, blue bruising, brown spore prints, and thick-fleshed forms.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2) reveal **Rubroboletus** as a distinct, well-supported lineage within Boletaceae, separate from _Boletus_ sensu stricto, _Butyriboletus_, and _Caloboletus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Rubroboletus
 ├── Caloboletus
 └── Butyriboletus
```
The genus likely evolved in temperate and Mediterranean ecosystems, specializing in partnerships with oaks and other hardwoods.

Important species include:

- _Rubroboletus satanas_ (Satan's bolete)
- _Rubroboletus pulchrotinctus_
- _Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Broadleaf and mixed forests, particularly oak and beech woodlands.
- **Substrates:** Soil near ectomycorrhizal partners.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, forming nutrient-exchange relationships with trees.

- **Geographic range:** Mainly Europe, East Asia, and North America; favoring warm temperate to Mediterranean climates.

Species typically fruit in summer and early autumn, especially after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Rubroboletus** fungi are both admired and treated with caution:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Rubroboletus satanas_) are toxic or cause gastrointestinal distress when eaten raw or undercooked.
  - Some closely related species are edible but must be identified with extreme care.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical partners in forest ecosystems, aiding in tree health and soil enrichment.

- **Scientific and cultural relevance:**
  - Their vivid colors, dramatic blue staining, and historical taxonomic confusion make them important study subjects.
  - _Rubroboletus satanas_ is often referenced in folklore and mushroom guides due to its "satanic" name and imposing appearance.

Their fiery colors, fascinating chemistry, and ecological roles make _Rubroboletus_ one of the most iconic genera among modern boletes.
