## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Caloboletus calopus_  
* **Authority & year:** Vizzini, 2014  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Fleshy boletes, striking coloration (red stipes, yellow pores), bitter taste, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Caloboletus** was described by **Alfredo Vizzini** in 2014 following molecular phylogenetic studies that revealed polyphyly within traditional _Boletus_. The name _Caloboletus_ means "beautiful bolete" (from Greek _kalos_ = "beautiful"), referring to the vibrant and often strikingly colorful appearance of these mushrooms.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Caloboletus** species are notable for their vivid colors and sturdy forms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry to slightly velvety, colored brownish to olive-brown.
  - Pore surfaces are bright yellow, bruising blue when damaged.
  - Stipes are robust, typically bright red or reddish with a yellow apex, sometimes reticulate.
  - Spore prints are olive-brown to brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, olive-brown in deposit, elongate to fusoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include bright yellow pores, reddish stipes, bitter-tasting flesh, blue staining reactions, and brown spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2) place **Caloboletus** as a distinct genus within Boletaceae, related to _Boletus_, _Rubroboletus_, and _Butyriboletus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Rubroboletus
 ├── Caloboletus
 └── Butyriboletus
```
The genus likely diversified in temperate forests, evolving alongside ectomycorrhizal tree lineages such as beech, oak, and pine.

Important species include:

- _Caloboletus calopus_ (the bitter bolete)
- _Caloboletus firmus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Mixed hardwood and coniferous forests, often with beech, oak, and spruce.
- **Substrates:** Soil near the roots of living trees.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, forming mutualistic relationships with trees.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread across Europe, North America, and parts of East Asia.

Species typically fruit in summer to autumn, often during warm wet periods.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Caloboletus** fungi are visually striking but have limited culinary value:

- **Edibility:**
  - Most species are considered inedible due to an extremely bitter taste (e.g., _Caloboletus calopus_).
  - No known serious toxicity, but their bitterness makes them unsuitable for consumption.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important ectomycorrhizal partners in forest ecosystems, supporting tree health and promoting forest biodiversity.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Their clear morphological traits and molecular distinctiveness make them valuable for studies of bolete evolution and biogeography.

Their brilliant colors and bitter nature make _Caloboletus_ a beautiful but cautionary genus for mushroom enthusiasts and an important group for forest ecosystem functioning.
