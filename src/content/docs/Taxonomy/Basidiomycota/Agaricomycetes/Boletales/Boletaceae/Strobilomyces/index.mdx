## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Strobilomyces strobilaceus_  
* **Authority & year:** Berk., 1851  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium to large boletes, woolly or scaly caps, dark spore prints, often black-staining, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Strobilomyces** was established by **Miles Joseph Berkeley** in 1851. The name derives from Greek _strobilos_ ("cone" or "pine cone") and _myces_ ("fungus"), referring to the shaggy, scaly appearance of the fruitbodies, resembling a pine cone.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Strobilomyces** species are distinctive among boletes for their coarse textures and dark colors:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly convex, densely covered with woolly scales or tufts, often gray, brown, or black.
  - Pore surfaces are initially pale, becoming dark gray to black with age; pores may bruise or stain blackish.
  - Stipes are stout, fibrous, often similarly scaly or woolly as the cap.
  - Spore prints are dark gray to black.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are ornamented, blackish in deposit, broadly ellipsoid to globose.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include woolly to scaly caps, dark pores and spore prints, ornamented spores, and tough flesh.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Strobilomyces** as a distinct and basal lineage within Boletaceae, separate from smoother-capped boletes like _Boletus_ and _Tylopilus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Rubroboletus
 ├── Tylopilus
 └── Strobilomyces
```
The genus likely evolved to specialize in humid, shaded forest environments where tougher, longer-lasting fruitbodies confer survival advantages.

Important species include:

- _Strobilomyces strobilaceus_ (old man of the woods)
- _Strobilomyces confusus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests (deciduous and coniferous), particularly in moist, shaded environments.
- **Substrates:** Soil near ectomycorrhizal tree partners like oaks, beeches, and pines.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan in distribution; found in temperate and tropical forests across North America, Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa and Australia.

Species typically fruit during warm, wet seasons, often persisting longer than more fragile boletes.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Strobilomyces** fungi are admired for their unusual appearance but are of limited culinary importance:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Strobilomyces strobilaceus_ is technically edible when young but often avoided due to tough texture and dark, unappealing appearance when cooked.
  - Flavor is mild but texture becomes coarse with age.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important ectomycorrhizal symbionts supporting tree health and forest stability.
  - Contribute to nutrient cycling and soil development.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - _S. strobilaceus_ is known as "old man of the woods" due to its shaggy, aged appearance, and is a common favorite among mushroom photographers and nature enthusiasts.

Their rugged beauty, fascinating textures, and crucial ecological roles make _Strobilomyces_ a charismatic genus within Boletaceae.
