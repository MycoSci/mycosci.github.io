# Xanthoconium <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Boletaceae › **Genus:** Xanthoconium

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Xanthoconium stramineum_  
* **Authority & year:** Singer, 1944  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium boletes, dry caps, pale to straw-colored tissues, yellowish-brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Xanthoconium** was erected by **Rolf Singer** in 1944. The name comes from Greek _xanthos_ ("yellow") and _conium_ (an old name for "bolete" or "fungus"), referring to the typically yellowish tones of these mushrooms.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Xanthoconium** species are subtle and earthy in their appearance:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly convex, dry, often smooth or finely velvety, colored pale tan, straw, or yellowish.
  - Pore surfaces are yellowish to olive and may bruise slightly brown but not blue.
  - Stipes are central, slender to stout, and concolorous or slightly paler than the cap.
  - Spore prints are yellowish-brown to ochre-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, pale yellowish-brown in deposit, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include pale coloration, dry cap surfaces, non-bluing flesh, and pale brown spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) suggest **Xanthoconium** is related to other pale-fleshed boletes but forms its own distinct lineage within Boletaceae.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Tylopilus
 ├── Xanthoconium
 └── Others
```
The genus likely diversified in North American forests alongside oak, beech, and hickory trees.

Important species include:

- _Xanthoconium stramineum_ (the straw-colored bolete)
- _Xanthoconium separans_ (the eastern bolete)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Mixed hardwood forests, particularly near oak, beech, and other broadleaf trees.
- **Substrates:** Soil near roots in ectomycorrhizal associations.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, forming mutualistic partnerships with trees.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily North America; possibly underrecorded elsewhere.

Species fruit in summer and autumn, particularly after rainfall.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Xanthoconium** fungi are modest but interesting ecologically:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species are edible (_e.g., X. separans_), offering a mild, pleasant flavor, though they are less popular compared to larger boletes.
  - Always verify identification before consumption.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important partners for tree nutrient acquisition, especially in nutrient-poor soils.
  - Help support forest resilience and biodiversity.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied to better understand the diversity of paler, non-bluing boletes and the evolutionary branching within Boletaceae.

Their quiet beauty and key roles in supporting forests make _Xanthoconium_ an important and underappreciated genus among North American boletes.
