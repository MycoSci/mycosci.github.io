## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Butyriboletus appendiculatus_  
* **Authority & year:** D. Arora & J.L. Frank, 2014  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Fleshy boletes, sticky to dry caps, often brightly colored, brown spore prints, blue-staining flesh (sometimes)  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Butyriboletus** was formally erected by **David Arora** and **Jonathan L. Frank** in 2014 following molecular phylogenetic analyses that revealed traditional _Boletus_ was polyphyletic. The name means "buttery bolete," referencing the smooth, sometimes greasy cap texture in many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Butyriboletus** species are characterized by bright colors and robust forms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, sticky to dry, often golden, yellow, brownish, or reddish.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to olive, sometimes bruising blue when injured.
  - Stipes are central, often thick and sometimes with slight reticulations near the apex.
  - Spore prints are brown to olive-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, elongated to fusoid, brown in deposit.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include yellow pore surfaces, buttery to dry caps, brown spore prints, and mostly ectomycorrhizal associations with trees.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2) show that **Butyriboletus** forms a distinct clade within Boletaceae, separated from core _Boletus_ (porcini) and allied genera like _Rubroboletus_ and _Aureoboletus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Butyriboletus
 ├── Rubroboletus
 ├── Aureoboletus
 └── Others
```
The genus likely diversified alongside the rise of temperate forests dominated by pines, oaks, and beeches during the late Cenozoic.

Important species include:

- _Butyriboletus appendiculatus_ (yellow foot bolete)
- _Butyriboletus fechtneri_ (Fechtner's bolete)
- _Butyriboletus regius_ (royal bolete)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Broadleaf forests, mixed woodlands, often under oaks, beeches, and pines.
- **Substrates:** Soil near ectomycorrhizal trees.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, forming nutrient-exchange partnerships with tree roots.

- **Geographic range:** Mainly Northern Hemisphere — Europe, North America, and parts of Asia.

Species often fruit after summer and autumn rains, typically appearing singly or scattered.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Butyriboletus** fungi are ecologically and gastronomically significant:

- **Edibility:**
  - Many species (_e.g., Butyriboletus appendiculatus_) are considered choice edibles.
  - Firm, mild-flavored flesh makes them popular in mushroom cuisine.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important partners in forest ecosystems, aiding trees with nutrient uptake and improving drought resilience.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Their clear separation from traditional _Boletus_ via DNA studies helps clarify bolete evolution and taxonomy.

Their vivid colors, delicious edibility, and ecological importance make _Butyriboletus_ a valued genus among mycologists and foragers.
