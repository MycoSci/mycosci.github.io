## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Phylloporus pelletieri_  
* **Authority & year:** Quél., 1888  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium boletes, gill-like pore surfaces, yellow to reddish colors, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Phylloporus** was described by **Lucien Quélet** in 1888. The name combines Greek _phyllo-_ ("leaf," here meaning "gill") and _porus_ ("pore"), reflecting the unusual appearance of gills formed by strongly elongated pores, blending features of both boletes and gilled mushrooms.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Phylloporus** species are striking for their unusual hymenophore structure:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly convex, dry to slightly viscid, usually yellow, red, brownish, or ochre.
  - Hymenophores resemble gills but are actually deeply folded or radially elongated pores.
  - Stipes are central, smooth to slightly fibrillose, often colored yellowish to reddish.
  - Spore prints are brown to olive-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, brown in deposit, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include "gill-like" pores, brightly colored tissues, and brown spore prints, along with ectomycorrhizal associations.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) position **Phylloporus** within Boletaceae, somewhat distantly related to typical poroid genera like _Boletus_ or _Xerocomus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Xerocomus
 ├── Phylloporus
 └── Others
```
The genus likely evolved as a specialization towards more gilled-like spore dispersal surfaces while retaining ecological roles similar to typical boletes.

Important species include:

- _Phylloporus pelletieri_ (European gilled bolete)
- _Phylloporus rhodoxanthus_
- _Phylloporus arenicola_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Mixed forests, tropical rainforests, coastal pine forests, often associated with oaks or pines.
- **Substrates:** Soil near living tree roots in ectomycorrhizal relationships.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, aiding nutrient exchange with trees.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in temperate and tropical forests in Europe, North America, Central America, Asia, and Africa.

Species often fruit after heavy summer or autumn rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Phylloporus** fungi are important ecologically and occasionally culinarily:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Phylloporus pelletieri_) are edible, although smaller size and thin flesh limit their culinary interest.
  - They are occasionally collected locally but are not major commercial edibles.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important in nutrient-poor forest soils, enhancing tree health and ecosystem resilience.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for understanding transitions between pore-bearing and gilled fungi within Boletales.

Their gill-like pores, bright coloration, and critical ectomycorrhizal roles make _Phylloporus_ an intriguing bridge between classic boletes and gilled mushrooms.
