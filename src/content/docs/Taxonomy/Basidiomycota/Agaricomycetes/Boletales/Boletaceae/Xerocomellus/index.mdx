# Xerocomellus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Boletaceae › **Genus:** Xerocomellus

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Xerocomellus chrysenteron_  
* **Authority & year:** Šutara, 2008  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium dry-capped boletes, cracking or crazed surfaces, dull brownish tones, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Xerocomellus** was described by **Josef Šutara** in 2008 after molecular analyses demonstrated that many traditional _Xerocomus_ species were phylogenetically distinct. The name combines _xeros_ ("dry") and _comellus_ (diminutive of "coma" for "hair"), referring to the dry, sometimes finely hairy cap surfaces.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Xerocomellus** species are characterized by their dry, cracking caps and smaller stature:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flattened, dry to velvety, often cracking or crazed, colored dull brown, olive, reddish, or yellowish.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to olive, bruising blue when damaged.
  - Stipes are slender to moderately thick, yellowish to reddish, often lacking strong reticulations.
  - Spore prints are olive-brown to brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, olive-brown in deposit, narrowly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include small to medium size, dry cracked caps, blue-staining pores, and brown spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) show **Xerocomellus** as a distinct lineage within Boletaceae, separate from _Boletus_, _Xerocomus_, and _Butyriboletus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Xerocomus
 ├── Xerocomellus
 └── Butyriboletus
```
The genus likely diversified in temperate forests, associating closely with oaks, beeches, birches, and conifers.

Important species include:

- _Xerocomellus chrysenteron_ (red cracking bolete)
- _Xerocomellus cisalpinus_
- _Xerocomellus pruinatus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Mixed woodlands, coniferous forests, grassy forest edges.
- **Substrates:** Soil near living trees in ectomycorrhizal relationships.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily Europe and North America; a few species described from Asia and Australasia.

Species fruit during summer and autumn, often following periods of rain.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Xerocomellus** fungi are modest in culinary value but important ecologically:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Xerocomellus chrysenteron_) are edible but considered mediocre due to their soft texture and tendency to age poorly.
  - Generally consumed locally where abundant but not highly sought.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important ectomycorrhizal partners, particularly for maintaining forest biodiversity and nutrient cycles.
  - Adapted to slightly disturbed and secondary forests.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Their clarification helped resolve confusion around bolete taxonomy, especially among small, brown-pored species.

Their modest appearance, reliable presence in woodlands, and role in forest health make _Xerocomellus_ a key genus among modern boletes.
