## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hortiboletus rubellus_  
* **Authority & year:** Simonini, Vizzini & Gelardi, 2014  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium boletes, dry caps, reddish or pinkish hues, yellow pores, brown spore prints, saprotrophic to ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Hortiboletus** was formally established by **Giampaolo Simonini**, **Alfredo Vizzini**, and **Matteo Gelardi** in 2014. The name combines _hortus_ ("garden") and _Boletus_, reflecting the frequent occurrence of these species in grassy, cultivated, or disturbed habitats.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hortiboletus** species are colorful, slender boletes with certain unifying traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry, often reddish, pinkish, brownish, or orange-tinted.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to olive-yellow, often bruising blue when handled.
  - Stipes are slender to moderately stout, yellowish to reddish, sometimes with faint reticulations.
  - Spore prints are brown to olive-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, brown in deposit, ellipsoid to subfusiform.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include reddish or pinkish dry caps, yellow pores, brown spore prints, and variable ecological associations.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) clearly separate **Hortiboletus** from _Xerocomus_, _Boletus_, and related genera. It forms a distinct lineage within Boletaceae.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Xerocomus
 ├── Hortiboletus
 ├── Hemileccinum
 └── Others
```
The genus likely diversified in disturbed soils, gardens, open woodlands, and grasslands, showing a range of nutritional strategies.

Important species include:

- _Hortiboletus rubellus_ (ruby bolete)
- _Hortiboletus engelii_
- _Hortiboletus bubalinus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Parks, gardens, grasslands, forest edges, disturbed soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil, sometimes in association with trees or grasses.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic or weakly ectomycorrhizal.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily Europe and Asia; some species extending into North America and North Africa.

Species often fruit in summer and early autumn, especially after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hortiboletus** fungi are ecologically significant and visually attractive:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Hortiboletus rubellus_ is considered **edible** by some sources but not highly valued due to mediocre flavor and delicate texture.
  - Caution: easily confused with toxic or inedible lookalikes.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Contribute to nutrient cycling in grassy and edge habitats.
  - Some species may aid early-stage forest succession through soil stabilization and nutrient enrichment.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for clarifying bolete evolution, particularly how habitat specialization shaped diversity in Boletaceae.

Their vibrant colors, suburban habitats, and modest ecological roles make _Hortiboletus_ a small but charming genus in the greater bolete lineage.
