# Leccinellum <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Boletaceae › **Genus:** Leccinellum

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Leccinellum lepidum_  
* **Authority & year:** Bresinsky & Manfr. Binder, 2003  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium boletes, dry caps with fine scales, yellow to olive pores, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Leccinellum** was described by **Andreas Bresinsky** and **Manfred Binder** in 2003 after molecular analyses revealed that some species previously grouped within _Leccinum_ formed a distinct clade. The name suggests a diminutive or variant form related to _Leccinum_.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Leccinellum** species show subtle but important distinguishing features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry, often covered with fine scales or fibrils.
  - Colors range from tan, yellowish-brown, to olive tones.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to olive, not strongly bruising or slightly staining grayish-brown.
  - Stipes are robust, pale to yellowish, often adorned with fine scabers (small dark scales).
  - Spore prints are brown to olive-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, olive-brown in deposit, narrowly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include dry scaly caps, brown spore prints, and ornamented stipes, distinct from smoother-capped relatives.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB1) confirm **Leccinellum** as a monophyletic genus within Boletaceae, distinct from _Leccinum_ and _Tylopilus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Leccinum
 ├── Leccinellum
 └── Others
```
The genus likely diversified with Mediterranean and temperate forest trees, particularly oaks and beeches.

Important species include:

- _Leccinellum lepidum_ (Mediterranean bolete)
- _Leccinellum corsicum_
- _Leccinellum crocipodium_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Mixed and broadleaf forests, especially Mediterranean oak forests, sandy soils, and forest edges.
- **Substrates:** Soil near tree roots in ectomycorrhizal associations.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, mutually beneficial partnerships with trees.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily Europe and the Mediterranean basin; less common in other regions.

Species often fruit after late summer and autumn rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Leccinellum** fungi are modest in culinary value but ecologically important:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species are edible (e.g., _Leccinellum lepidum_), though texture can be variable, and they are often less sought after compared to larger boletes.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Key players in Mediterranean forest ecosystems, aiding trees' nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor or drought-prone soils.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for understanding diversification patterns among boletes in southern European ecosystems.

Their small stature, subtle beauty, and ecological partnerships make _Leccinellum_ a noteworthy genus within the diverse Boletaceae.
