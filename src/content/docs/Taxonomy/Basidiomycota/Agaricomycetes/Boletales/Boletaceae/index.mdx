**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Boletaceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Boletus edulis_ (for the type genus _Boletus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Chevallier, 1826  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Fleshy mushrooms with pores instead of gills, stout central stipes, brown to olive-brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Boletaceae** was formally named by **François Fulgis Chevallier** in 1826. The name is derived from Latin _boletus_, meaning "mushroom," traditionally referring to choice edible species like porcini. 

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Boletaceae** fungi are instantly recognizable by their classic "bolete" features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are fleshy, convex to flattened, often smooth, velvety, or slightly sticky.
  - Hymenophore consists of tubes and pores (no gills), typically easily separable from the cap flesh.
  - Stipes are thick, robust, and often decorated with net-like patterns (reticulations) or color changes.
  - Spore prints are olive-brown to brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth to finely ornamented, olive to brown in deposit, often fusoid (spindle-shaped).
  - Clamp connections are generally absent.

**Synapomorphies** include fleshy fruitbodies with tubes and pores, brownish spore prints, and strong mycorrhizal symbiosis with trees.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2) support **Boletaceae** as a highly diverse monophyletic family within Boletales.

Major genera include:

- _Boletus_ (porcini and allies)
- _Leccinum_ (scaber stalks)
- _Tylopilus_ (bitter boletes)
- _Xerocomus_ (soft boletes)
- _Butyriboletus_
- _Lanmaoa_

      ├── Xerocomus
      ├── Butyriboletus
      └── Lanmaoa
```
The family likely diversified with the spread of temperate and boreal forests, evolving close partnerships with ectomycorrhizal tree species like oaks, pines, firs, and beeches.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, often under hardwoods and conifers; occasionally in grasslands or alpine areas.
- **Substrates:** Soil near tree roots; never truly lignicolous (on wood).
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with tree roots to exchange nutrients.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; highly diverse across temperate, tropical, and boreal forests worldwide.

Species often fruit after rains in late summer and autumn, appearing singly, scattered, or in troops.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Boletaceae** fungi are among the most celebrated and economically important mushrooms globally:

- **Edibility:**
  - Many species (e.g., _Boletus edulis_, porcini) are prized culinary mushrooms, valued for their nutty, savory flavor.
  - Some species (e.g., _Tylopilus felleus_) are bitter and inedible; a few are mildly toxic.

- **Culinary significance:**
  - Porcini are a staple in Italian, French, Chinese, and other cuisines.
  - Boletes are dried, preserved, and traded globally as gourmet products.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Ectomycorrhizal partnerships are crucial for tree health, drought resistance, and nutrient cycling.
  - Some species are key indicators of forest ecosystem health.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Foraged in traditional foodways across Europe, North America, and Asia.
  - Celebrated in mushroom festivals and regional cuisines.

Their fleshy beauty, forest partnerships, and economic value make Boletaceae a keystone family among edible and ecological mushrooms.
