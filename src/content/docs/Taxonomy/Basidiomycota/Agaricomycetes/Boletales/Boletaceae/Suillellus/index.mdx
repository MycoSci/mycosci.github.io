# Suillellus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Boletaceae › **Genus:** Suillellus

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Suillellus luridus_  
* **Authority & year:** Murrill, 1909  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium to large boletes, colorful (often reddish stipes and yellow pores), strong blue-staining when bruised, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Suillellus** was first proposed by **William Alphonso Murrill** in 1909 but only widely accepted after molecular phylogenetic studies clarified the polyphyly of traditional _Boletus_. The name may derive from Latin roots referring to "swine" (_sui-_) and "little," a poetic nod to the habitat or robust appearance.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Suillellus** species are vibrant and show dramatic bruising reactions:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly convex, dry to slightly velvety, often colored olive-brown, reddish, or orange.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to orange, quickly bruising intense blue when handled.
  - Stipes are thick, often prominently red or orange, with strong reticulations (net-like patterns) near the apex.
  - Spore prints are olive-brown to brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, olive-brown in deposit, broadly ellipsoid to subfusiform.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include colorful caps and stipes, blue-staining flesh, brown spore prints, and robust mycorrhizal partnerships.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2) strongly support **Suillellus** as a distinct clade within Boletaceae, separate from _Boletus_, _Rubroboletus_, and _Neoboletus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Suillellus
 ├── Rubroboletus
 └── Neoboletus
```
The genus likely diversified alongside oak and beech forests, particularly in Europe and Asia.

Important species include:

- _Suillellus luridus_ (lurid bolete)
- _Suillellus queletii_
- _Suillellus comptus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Mixed hardwood forests, often under oak, beech, or hornbeam.
- **Substrates:** Soil near tree roots in ectomycorrhizal associations.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, mutually beneficial exchanges with tree hosts.

- **Geographic range:** Mainly Europe, extending into Asia and reported in parts of North America.

Species fruit during summer and autumn, often after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Suillellus** fungi are beautiful but demand caution:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Suillellus luridus_ is considered edible **only when thoroughly cooked** — raw or undercooked specimens can cause serious gastrointestinal distress.
  - Caution is essential due to toxic confusion with similarly blue-staining but poisonous species.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Critical ectomycorrhizal partners, particularly in nutrient-poor soils.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for understanding bolete evolution and the role of blue-staining chemistry as a potential defense mechanism.

Their dramatic colors, powerful staining reactions, and key ecological roles make _Suillellus_ one of the most fascinating modern genera of boletes.
