## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Aureoboletus gentilis_  
* **Authority & year:** Pouzar, 1957  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Fleshy boletes with sticky or viscid caps, often brightly colored (golden to yellow), brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Aureoboletus** was formally described by **Zdeněk Pouzar** in 1957. The name combines Latin _aureus_ ("golden") and _Boletus_, referring to the often bright golden hues seen in many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Aureoboletus** species are distinguished by their striking appearances:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, usually slimy or sticky when moist, often golden yellow to orange, sometimes brownish.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to golden, sometimes bruising blue or brown with age.
  - Stipes are central, smooth to finely reticulate, often brightly colored to match the cap.
  - Spore prints are brown to olive-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, fusiform to ellipsoid, brownish in deposit.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include bright cap colors, sticky surfaces, brown spore prints, and ectomycorrhizal lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Aureoboletus** securely within Boletaceae, related to genera like _Boletus_, _Butyriboletus_, and _Lanmaoa_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Butyriboletus
 ├── Aureoboletus
 └── Lanmaoa
```
The genus likely diversified with ectomycorrhizal tree lineages during the late Cenozoic, especially alongside oak, beech, and pine forests.

Important species include:

- _Aureoboletus mirabilis_ (admirable bolete)
- _Aureoboletus projectellus_
- _Aureoboletus gentilis_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors in both coniferous and mixed hardwood forests.
- **Substrates:** Soil near ectomycorrhizal partners like pines, oaks, and beeches.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with tree roots.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed in North America, Europe, and East Asia, with greatest diversity in temperate to subtropical regions.

Species typically fruit after rains in summer to autumn, often appearing singly or scattered.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Aureoboletus** fungi are ecologically important and visually stunning:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Aureoboletus mirabilis_) are considered edible and choice when young, with a sweet, mild flavor.
  - Others are avoided due to sliminess or mediocre taste.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Vital partners in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems, supporting tree health and biodiversity.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for insights into bolete evolution, color adaptations, and mycorrhizal specificity.

Their dazzling colors, key ecological roles, and occasional culinary value make _Aureoboletus_ an exciting and cherished genus for mycologists and foragers alike.
