## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Retiboletus griseus_  
* **Authority & year:** Manfred Binder & Bresinsky, 2002  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized boletes, dry caps, strong reticulation (netting) on stipes, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Retiboletus** was formally described by **Manfred Binder** and **Andreas Bresinsky** in 2002. The name combines Latin _reti-_ ("net") and _Boletus_, referring to the prominent net-like reticulations on the stipe, a hallmark feature of this group.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Retiboletus** species are easily recognized by their strong stipe ornamentation:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flattened, dry, often velvety or finely tomentose.
  - Colors are typically grayish, brown, or olive tones.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to olive-yellow, bruising blue or brown when handled.
  - Stipes are stout, heavily reticulate (netted) near the apex and often colored pale yellowish or brown.
  - Spore prints are olive-brown to brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, brown in deposit, narrowly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include strong net-like reticulation on stipes, brown spore prints, and dry cap textures.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) confirm **Retiboletus** as a distinct genus within Boletaceae, closely related to _Boletus_, _Tylopilus_, and _Xerocomus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Tylopilus
 ├── Retiboletus
 └── Others
```
The genus likely diversified with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate forests, especially oaks, beeches, and pines.

Important species include:

- _Retiboletus griseus_ (gray bolete)
- _Retiboletus ornatipes_ (ornate-stalked bolete)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Deciduous and mixed forests, often associated with oak, beech, or pine trees.
- **Substrates:** Soil near tree roots in ectomycorrhizal partnerships.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, exchanging nutrients with host trees.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily temperate regions of North America, Europe, and East Asia.

Species fruit in late summer and autumn, usually after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Retiboletus** fungi are modestly known but ecologically important:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Retiboletus griseus_) are edible but not highly esteemed due to mild flavor or tough texture.
  - As always with boletes, caution is necessary to avoid confusing them with bitter or toxic lookalikes.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important ectomycorrhizal partners supporting healthy forests.
  - Contribute to forest resilience and biodiversity through nutrient cycling.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Help clarify evolutionary relationships among brown-pored boletes with heavily ornamented stems.

Their beautiful netted stems and symbiotic roles make _Retiboletus_ a distinctive and ecologically valuable genus in the Boletaceae.
