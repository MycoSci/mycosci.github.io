# Sclerodermataceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Sclerodermataceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Scleroderma citrinum_ (for the type genus _Scleroderma_)  
* **Authority & year:** Demoulin & Malençon, 1970  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gasteroid fungi (earthballs), tough-skinned fruitbodies, dark gleba at maturity, brownish to black spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Sclerodermataceae** was described by **André Demoulin** and **Georges Malençon** in 1970, grouping together tough-skinned gasteroid fungi allied with the Boletales. The name comes from Greek _sclero-_ ("hard") and _derma_ ("skin"), referring to the firm peridium (outer skin) of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sclerodermataceae** fungi are distinguished by their earthball-like appearance:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are globose to irregular, hypogeous (underground) or emergent, typically tough and thick-skinned.
  - Peridium is thick, firm, sometimes warty, scaly, or cracked.
  - Gleba (internal spore mass) changes from white to dark purple-brown to black as spores mature.
  - No distinct stipe; fruitbodies rest directly on or just beneath the soil surface.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are variably present; basidiospores often develop directly inside the gleba.
  - Spores are ornamented (warted, reticulate), thick-walled, dark brown in mass.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include thick-walled peridia, ornamented spores, dark mature gleba, and brown to blackish spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Sclerodermataceae** as a distinct lineage within Boletales, separate from true boletes (Boletaceae) and other gasteroid groups like Rhizopogonaceae.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletales
 ├── Boletaceae
 ├── Rhizopogonaceae
 └── Sclerodermataceae
```
The family likely evolved as a specialized group adapted for dry, sandy, or disturbed habitats where animal-mediated spore dispersal is advantageous.

Major genera:

- _Scleroderma_ (earthballs)
- _Pisolithus_ (dyeballs)
- _Astraeus_ (false earthstars — sometimes included or closely allied)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Woodlands, heathlands, grasslands, urban parks, and disturbed areas.
- **Substrates:** Soil, often sandy or poor in organic matter.
- **Trophic modes:** Primarily ectomycorrhizal; partners of pines, oaks, and other broadleaf trees.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions.

Species often fruit during dry seasons or after rains in nutrient-poor soils.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sclerodermataceae** fungi are important both ecologically and culturally:

- **Edibility:**
  - Most _Scleroderma_ species are **toxic** or **inedible**, causing gastrointestinal distress if consumed.
  - _Pisolithus_ species are not consumed but are valuable for other reasons (e.g., soil restoration).

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Vital ectomycorrhizal partners for trees in stressed or poor soil conditions.
  - Pioneer fungi aiding in reforestation, mine reclamation, and soil stabilization.

- **Scientific and economic relevance:**
  - _Pisolithus tinctorius_ is used commercially to inoculate tree seedlings in forestry and land restoration projects.
  - _Scleroderma_ species are studied for their hardiness and fungal-plant interaction models.

Their tough resilience, hidden mycorrhizal roles, and critical value in ecosystem recovery make _Sclerodermataceae_ an essential and fascinating family within Boletales.
