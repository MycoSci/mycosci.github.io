## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Fuscoboletinus granulatus_  
* **Authority & year:** Singer, 1945  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Slimy-capped boletes, yellowish to brownish pores, association with larch trees, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Fuscoboletinus** was described by **Rolf Singer** in 1945 to accommodate slimy, conifer-associated boletes previously grouped under _Suillus_ but showing enough distinctness to warrant separation. The name combines Latin _fusco-_ ("dark") and _Boletinus_ (an old term for small boletes), reflecting their typically darkish, slimy appearance.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Fuscoboletinus** species closely resemble _Suillus_ but with subtle distinguishing features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly convex, dry to highly viscid (slimy) when wet, often brownish to reddish-brown.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to ochre, sometimes bruising slightly brownish.
  - Stipes are slender to moderately thick, often with glandular dots but less prominently reticulate.
  - Spore prints are brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, brown in mass, narrowly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include slimy brown caps, yellowish pores, brown spore prints, and ectomycorrhizal ecology with conifers, especially larches (_Larix_).

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) suggest that **Fuscoboletinus** forms a close relationship within Suillaceae but remains separate from core _Suillus_ species.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Suillaceae
 ├── Suillus
 └── Fuscoboletinus
```
The genus likely specialized for cooler, larch-dominated ecosystems, adapting to form specific ectomycorrhizal partnerships.

Important species include:

- _Fuscoboletinus granulatus_ (formerly _Suillus granulatus_)
- _Fuscoboletinus thermophilus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Boreal and montane forests dominated by larches (_Larix_).
- **Substrates:** Soil near tree roots, forming ectomycorrhizal connections.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, facilitating nutrient and water exchange with conifers.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily Northern Hemisphere — North America, Europe, and parts of East Asia.

Species fruit during summer and autumn, often in association with cooler climates and wet seasons.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Fuscoboletinus** fungi are modest but ecologically important:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species are reported as edible when young (_e.g., F. granulatus_), but slimy textures and rapid spoilage limit culinary appeal.
  - As with other Suillaceae, peeling the slimy cuticle improves edibility.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical symbionts in boreal and montane ecosystems, supporting tree growth under cold and nutrient-poor conditions.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important models for understanding fungal specialization to specific tree hosts and adaptation to extreme environments.

Their slimy resilience, partnership with larch forests, and ecological necessity make _Fuscoboletinus_ a distinctive genus within Suillaceae.
