# Suillaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Suillaceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Suillus luteus_ (for the type genus _Suillus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Lutzoni, Kauff, & O. K. Miller, 2004  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Slippery or viscid-capped boletes, glandular dots on stipes, yellowish pore surfaces, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal with conifers  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Suillaceae** was formally established by molecular work led by **François Lutzoni**, **David Kauff**, and **Orson K. Miller** in 2004. It accommodates a distinct group of boletes associated primarily with conifers. The name derives from the type genus _Suillus_, meaning "swine-like" in Latin, likely referring to the greasy or slimy appearance of the caps.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Suillaceae** fungi are fleshy boletes specialized for pine partnerships:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry to highly viscid (slimy) when wet, colored yellow, brown, orange, or reddish.
  - Pore surfaces are typically yellow, aging to darker shades; pores are large and angular.
  - Stipes are central, often with glandular dots or small dark spots near the apex.
  - Spore prints are olive-brown to cinnamon-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, fusiform to ellipsoid, brownish in mass.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include slimy caps (often), glandular-dotted stipes, brown spore prints, and strong ectomycorrhizal ties with Pinaceae (pines, larches, etc.).

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb1, rpb2) place **Suillaceae** as a distinct family within Boletales, sister to Boletaceae but clearly divergent.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletales
 ├── Boletaceae
 ├── Sclerodermataceae
 ├── Gomphidiaceae
 └── Suillaceae
```
The family likely evolved specifically alongside pine forests, specializing in host specificity and rapid colonization after disturbance.

Major genera:

- _Suillus_ (the largest and most well-known)
- _Fuscoboletinus_
- _Rhizopogon_ (closely related but often placed separately)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Pine forests, larch groves, alpine conifer zones.
- **Substrates:** Soil closely associated with ectomycorrhizal hosts.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, essential for conifer seedling establishment and health.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; particularly abundant in the Northern Hemisphere (Europe, North America, Asia).

Species fruit during summer and autumn, often forming dense fruiting groups after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Suillaceae** fungi are important for forests and occasionally appreciated by foragers:

- **Edibility:**
  - Several _Suillus_ species (_e.g., Suillus luteus_, _Suillus granulatus_) are edible, valued locally for their mild flavor, though slimy caps may deter some.
  - Peeling the viscid cap skin improves texture and digestibility.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical in early successional stages of pine forest development.
  - Provide essential ectomycorrhizal support to pines in nutrient-poor or disturbed soils.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Model systems for studying host-fungal specificity, forest ecology, and climate adaptation.

Their slimy beauty, strong pine partnerships, and role in global forestry make _Suillaceae_ a family of vital ecological importance.
