# Suillus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Suillaceae › **Genus:** Suillus

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Suillus luteus_  
* **Authority & year:** Micheli ex S.F. Gray, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Slimy-capped boletes, yellow to brown pore surfaces, glandular dots on stipes, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal with conifers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Suillus** was first described by **Pier Antonio Micheli** (attributed formally by **Samuel Frederick Gray** in 1821). The name _Suillus_ means "of swine" in Latin, possibly a playful reference to the greasy (slimy) nature of the caps, resembling the oily skin of pigs.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Suillus** species are among the most easily recognized boletes:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, smooth, often slimy to very viscid when wet, typically colored yellowish, brown, orange, or reddish.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to yellow-brown, sometimes bruising brown but rarely blue.
  - Stipes are typically central, often ornamented with dark glandular dots.
  - Spore prints are cinnamon to olive-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, brown in mass, elongated to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include slimy caps, yellow pores, brown spore prints, and a strong ectomycorrhizal association with conifers (especially pines and larches).

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb1, rpb2) place **Suillus** as the core genus within Suillaceae, distinct from related genera like _Fuscoboletinus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Suillaceae
 └── Suillus
```
The genus likely evolved specialized host-specific ectomycorrhizal relationships with members of Pinaceae (pines, larches, firs).

Important species include:

- _Suillus luteus_ (slippery jack)
- _Suillus granulatus_
- _Suillus grevillei_ (larch bolete)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous forests, pine plantations, larch groves, and boreal woodlands.
- **Substrates:** Soil, forming ectomycorrhizal symbioses with roots of pines, spruces, larches, and firs.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread across the Northern Hemisphere; some species introduced to the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Australia, New Zealand) with pine plantations.

Species fruit prolifically after summer and autumn rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Suillus** fungi are important for both forestry and cuisine:

- **Edibility:**
  - Many species are edible (_e.g., Suillus luteus, Suillus granulatus_), especially in Europe and Asia.
  - Caps are typically peeled to remove the slimy cuticle before cooking to improve texture and flavor.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Key ectomycorrhizal partners aiding pine survival and establishment in harsh soils.
  - Used in reforestation efforts and soil reclamation projects.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Models for studying host specificity, fungal colonization in young forests, and ectomycorrhizal dynamics under environmental stress.

Their slimy caps, pine-loving habits, and culinary appeal make _Suillus_ one of the most important genera within Boletales and forest ecosystems.
