# Hygrophoropsidaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Hygrophoropsidaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca_ (for the type genus _Hygrophoropsis_)  
* **Authority & year:** Kühner ex Singer, 1946  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gilled fungi with funnel-shaped caps, orange to yellow tones, white to pale spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Hygrophoropsidaceae** was established by **Rolf Singer** in 1946 based on _Hygrophoropsis_, a genus of gilled fungi resembling chanterelles but actually belonging to the Boletales. The name _Hygrophoropsis_ refers to the superficial resemblance ("-opsis") to _Hygrophorus_, although they are unrelated.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hygrophoropsidaceae** members are notable for their chanterelle-like appearance but different microscopic traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are funnel-shaped (infundibuliform), dry or slightly moist, orange, yellow, or pale brown.
  - Gills are decurrent, forked, and relatively soft, colored similarly to the cap.
  - Stipes are central to slightly off-center, slender to moderately thick.
  - Spore prints are white to pale cream.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are often present.

**Synapomorphies** include soft, often bright-colored fruitbodies, decurrent and sometimes forking gills, and pale spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) position **Hygrophoropsidaceae** as a distinct lineage within Boletales, far removed from typical pore-bearing boletes.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletales
 ├── Boletaceae
 ├── Sclerodermataceae
 ├── Gomphidiaceae
 └── Hygrophoropsidaceae
```
The family likely evolved by adapting gill-like structures independently for spore dispersal, convergent with true agarics.

Major genera:

- _Hygrophoropsis_ (e.g., _Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca_)
- _Leucogyrophana_ (sometimes included in broader treatments)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous and mixed woodlands, heathlands, mossy soils, and forest litter.
- **Substrates:** Dead wood, needle litter, and decomposing organic matter.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing plant litter and woody debris.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan, especially widespread in temperate zones of Europe, North America, and Asia.

Species often fruit in late summer and autumn following rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hygrophoropsidaceae** fungi are modestly recognized:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca_ ("false chanterelle") is sometimes collected but is generally regarded as edible with caution; older specimens can cause digestive upset.
  - Easily confused with true chanterelles (_Cantharellus_), but _Hygrophoropsis_ is less desirable and needs careful identification.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers in forest ecosystems, helping to recycle nutrients from wood and leaf litter.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for insights into convergent evolution of gill structures within Boletales.

Their soft orange beauty, deceptive resemblance to chanterelles, and important saprotrophic roles make _Hygrophoropsidaceae_ a fascinating family for both foragers and ecologists.
