# Boletales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Boletus edulis_ (for the type genus _Boletus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Gilbert, 1931  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Mostly fleshy mushrooms with pores (not gills), often mycorrhizal, brown to olive spore prints  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Boletales** was first formally recognized by **Gilbert** in 1931. It was initially grouped primarily by the presence of pores under the cap rather than gills, but molecular studies have since shown that Boletales includes a much greater morphological diversity. The name is based on the Latin _boletus_, meaning "mushroom," particularly edible ones.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Boletales** fungi are a structurally diverse group, but many share a typical "bolete" form:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are fleshy, often convex, expanding with age.
  - Hymenophore (spore-bearing surface) usually consists of pores or tubes instead of gills.
  - Stipes are central, stout, sometimes with reticulations (net-like patterns) or ornamentation.
  - Spore prints are brown to olive-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, elongated to fusiform (spindle-shaped).
  - Clamp connections are usually absent.

**Synapomorphies** include pore-bearing hymenophores (in most families), brown spore prints, and strong ectomycorrhizal associations with trees.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetics (ITS, LSU, rpb1, rpb2) has greatly expanded the known scope of **Boletales**, showing that some "bolete-like" and "non-bolete" fungi (e.g., earthballs, false truffles, and even some gilled species) all belong here.

Major families include:

- _Boletaceae_ (true boletes)
- _Suillaceae_ (slippery jacks)
- _Sclerodermataceae_ (earthballs)
- _Gyroporaceae_
- _Paxillaceae_
- _Tapinellaceae_ (gilled members)
- _Gomphidiaceae_ (gilled boletes)
- _Rhizopogonaceae_ (false truffles)

Boletales
 ├── Boletaceae
 ├── Suillaceae
 ├── Sclerodermataceae
 ├── Gyroporaceae
 ├── Gomphidiaceae
 ├── Paxillaceae
 ├── Tapinellaceae
 └── Rhizopogonaceae
```
The order likely diversified alongside the radiation of ectomycorrhizal trees (e.g., pines, oaks, beeches) during the Cretaceous and Cenozoic periods.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests, woodlands, heathlands, often associated with tree roots.
- **Substrates:** Soil, near living ectomycorrhizal partners; occasionally rotting wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Primarily ectomycorrhizal; some saprotrophic and parasitic species.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; abundant and diverse in temperate, tropical, and boreal forests worldwide.

Species typically fruit seasonally, often in summer and autumn, and are prominent features of mushroom foraging.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Boletales** fungi are highly significant in culinary, ecological, and scientific contexts:

- **Edibility:**
  - Many species (e.g., _Boletus edulis_ — porcini) are prized edible mushrooms with high economic value.
  - Some are toxic (_e.g.,_ _Boletus satanas_, _Scleroderma citrinum_), so accurate identification is critical.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Vital partners in ectomycorrhizal symbioses, helping trees access water and nutrients.
  - Important decomposers (especially saprotrophic and false-truffle species).

- **Scientific and cultural relevance:**
  - _Boletus edulis_ is central to European culinary traditions.
  - Species like _Rhizopogon_ are studied for their roles in forest health and mycorrhizal networks.

Their diversity, ecological partnerships, and culinary fame make Boletales one of the most fascinating and ecologically essential fungal orders.
