# Paxillaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Paxillaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Paxillus involutus_ (for the type genus _Paxillus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Lotsy, 1907  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gilled or poroid fungi, brownish caps, decurrent gills or tubes, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Paxillaceae** was described by **Johannes Paulus Lotsy** in 1907 to encompass fungi like _Paxillus_ and its relatives, which display features intermediate between gilled agarics and pore-bearing boletes. The name derives from the Latin "paxillus" meaning "peg" or "small stake," referencing the robust, sturdy nature of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Paxillaceae** fungi vary in hymenophore structure but share key traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to funnel-shaped, often brownish to ochre, dry to slightly viscid.
  - Hymenophores can be true gills (decurrent and sometimes forked) or pore-like plates.
  - Stipes are central or slightly off-center, often robust.
  - Spore prints are brown to reddish-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth to ornamented, brown in deposit, often ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include decurrent gills or pore-plates, brown spore prints, and ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Paxillaceae** within Boletales, closely related to _Boletaceae_ but clearly distinct. The family includes gilled fungi that evolved independently from the boletoid ancestor.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletales
 ├── Boletaceae
 ├── Paxillaceae
 └── Others
```
The family likely represents a lineage adapting to various temperate forest niches, with some members specializing in ectomycorrhizal symbioses.

Major genera:

- _Paxillus_ (classic brown-capped funnel gilled fungi)
- _Gyrodon_ (poroid, boletoid forms)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Temperate forests, coniferous and broadleaf woodlands, often near birch, pine, alder, and oak.
- **Substrates:** Soil near living trees or decaying organic matter.
- **Trophic modes:** Primarily ectomycorrhizal (_Paxillus_), with some saprotrophic tendencies (_Gyrodon_).

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North America.

Species often fruit from summer into late autumn, typically after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Paxillaceae** fungi have important ecological and cautionary significance:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Paxillus involutus_ was once considered edible but is now **recognized as poisonous**, causing potentially fatal immune-mediated hemolysis after repeated consumption.
  - _Gyrodon_ species are generally not considered edible.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key ectomycorrhizal symbionts, especially with birch and alder trees, aiding nutrient exchange and forest stability.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important in studies of fungal evolution — especially the transition between gilled and pore-bearing structures.
  - _Paxillus involutus_ has been a model organism for mycorrhizal research.

Their varied forms, vital forest partnerships, and complex toxicology make _Paxillaceae_ an intriguing and ecologically crucial family within Boletales.
