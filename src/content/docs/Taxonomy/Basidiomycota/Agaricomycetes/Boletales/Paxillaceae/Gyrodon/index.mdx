# Gyrodon <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Paxillaceae › **Genus:** Gyrodon

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Gyrodon lividus_  
* **Authority & year:** Opat., 1836  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium boletes, pore surfaces irregular and almost gill-like, yellow to brown tones, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Gyrodon** was described by **Wilhelm Opatowski** in 1836. The name derives from Greek _gyros_ ("circle" or "curved") and _odon_ ("tooth"), referring to the irregular, wrinkled, almost gill-like pore surface structure.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Gyrodon** species blur the lines between typical boletes and gilled fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to depressed, dry to slightly sticky, colored yellow, olive, tan, or brownish.
  - Hymenophore is poroid but often irregular, with angular to almost gill-like pores.
  - Pore surfaces are yellowish, sometimes bruising slightly brown or olive.
  - Stipes are short to moderately long, usually colored like the cap or paler.
  - Spore prints are brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, brown in deposit, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include irregular, almost gill-like pores, dry brownish caps, and brown spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Gyrodon** belongs within Paxillaceae, alongside _Paxillus_, despite its boletoid affinities.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Paxillaceae
 ├── Paxillus
 └── Gyrodon
```
The genus likely represents an intermediate form in the evolution between typical boletoid pores and true lamellae (gills).

Important species include:

- _Gyrodon lividus_ (type species)
- _Gyrodon monticola_
- _Gyrodon merulioides_ (sometimes considered synonymous or related)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist woodlands, particularly near alder and other wet-loving trees.
- **Substrates:** Soil near living tree roots, forming ectomycorrhizal relationships.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, mutually beneficial with trees, especially in riparian or wet forest zones.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily Europe and North America, with a few records in temperate Asia.

Species fruit in late summer and autumn after heavy rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Gyrodon** fungi are modest but scientifically and ecologically important:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not widely considered edible; some reports suggest edibility, but most species are ignored due to their small size, fragile structure, or mediocre taste.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important symbionts of riparian (streamside) trees like alder (_Alnus_), supporting nitrogen-fixing ecosystems.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Provide insights into fungal evolution, especially regarding transitions between pore and gill morphologies.

Their quiet presence in wet forests, important symbioses, and unique morphology make _Gyrodon_ an interesting and valuable genus within the Paxillaceae.
