## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Paxillus involutus_  
* **Authority & year:** (Batsch) Fr., 1838  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized mushrooms, brownish caps, decurrent gills, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Paxillus** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1838, based on earlier naming by **August Batsch**. The name is Latin for "peg" or "small stake," possibly referring to the sturdy, robust fruitbody appearance typical of species in this genus.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Paxillus** species are recognized by their brown tones and decurrent gills:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to funnel-shaped, dry to slightly velvety, brown to yellow-brown or ochre.
  - Gills are decurrent, easily detached from the cap flesh, often bruising brown on handling.
  - Stipes are stout, central to slightly off-center, smooth, and similarly colored to the cap.
  - Spore prints are brown to reddish-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, brown, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include brown decurrent gills, bruising reactions, brown spore prints, and mycorrhizal lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Paxillus** as the core genus of Paxillaceae, distinct from _Boletaceae_ and other boletoid fungi.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Paxillaceae
 ├── Paxillus
 └── Gyrodon
```
The genus likely diversified with northern temperate trees, especially birch (_Betula_) and alder (_Alnus_).

Important species include:

- _Paxillus involutus_ (brown roll-rim)
- _Paxillus rubicundulus_ (associated with alder)
- _Paxillus obscurisporus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests, woodlands, urban parks; often near birch, alder, and conifers.
- **Substrates:** Soil; ectomycorrhizal with various trees.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, facilitating nutrient exchange with host trees.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia.

Species typically fruit from late summer into autumn, especially after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Paxillus** fungi are ecologically important but require great caution:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Paxillus involutus_ was historically eaten but is now known to be **poisonous**, capable of causing fatal autoimmune hemolysis upon repeated consumption.
  - All Paxillus species should be considered **toxic** and **inedible**.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important symbionts for nutrient cycling in boreal and temperate ecosystems.
  - Play a role in the health of birch, alder, and some conifer forests.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - _Paxillus involutus_ is a model organism for mycorrhizal studies and soil microbial interactions.

Their sturdy forms, forest partnerships, and toxicity history make _Paxillus_ an iconic but cautionary genus among mushroom enthusiasts.
