# Boletinellaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Boletinellaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Boletinellus merulioides_ (for the type genus _Boletinellus_)  
* **Authority & year:** E.-J. Gilbert, 1931  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized boletes with dry caps, often reticulated or wrinkled stipes, brown spore prints, saprotrophic or associated with tree roots  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Boletinellaceae** was proposed by **Ernest Jean Gilbert** in 1931 to accommodate certain boletes that differed from _Boletaceae_ sensu stricto, primarily based on ecological and morphological traits. It is named after the type genus _Boletinellus_.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Boletinellaceae** fungi resemble typical boletes but with unique distinguishing features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry to slightly sticky, smooth to cracked, colored tan, yellow-brown, or olive.
  - Pore surfaces are yellowish, aging to olive or brown, usually not staining blue when bruised.
  - Stipes are central, sometimes swollen or wrinkled, pale to brownish, and dry.
  - Spore prints are olive-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, olive-brown in deposit, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are typically absent.

**Synapomorphies** include dry caps, brownish spore prints, lack of significant bruising, and often a somewhat saprotrophic or facultative ectomycorrhizal habit.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Boletinellaceae** as a distinct family within Boletales, although it is closely related to _Boletaceae_ and _Gyroporaceae_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletales
 ├── Boletaceae
 ├── Gyroporaceae
 └── Boletinellaceae
```
The family likely represents an early-diverging branch within the broader bolete clade, adapting to diverse ecological strategies.

Major genera:

- _Boletinellus_ (e.g., _Boletinellus merulioides_)
- _Phlebopus_ (larger tropical species, sometimes included)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest edges, near hardwoods (especially ashes), occasionally in grasslands or tropical woodlands.
- **Substrates:** Soil; sometimes associated with tree roots or ants.
- **Trophic modes:** Primarily saprotrophic; some species suspected of weak ectomycorrhizal or parasitic relationships.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan but especially common in temperate North America and tropical regions (South America, Southeast Asia, Africa).

Species often fruit after heavy rains, during late summer and early autumn.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Boletinellaceae** fungi are modest but ecologically significant:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species like _Boletinellus merulioides_ are technically edible but have a poor texture or flavor, limiting culinary interest.
  - _Phlebopus_ species (if included) are larger and can be edible, especially in tropical countries.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers and occasional weak symbionts of trees.
  - Some (e.g., _Boletinellus_) have unusual ecological relationships, such as growing near ash trees colonized by aphids and ants.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for understanding saprotrophic-to-mycorrhizal transitions within Boletales.
  - Their relationships to ants and other invertebrates are under active research.

Their odd habits, dry robust forms, and ecological flexibility make _Boletinellaceae_ a fascinating small family within the Boletales.
