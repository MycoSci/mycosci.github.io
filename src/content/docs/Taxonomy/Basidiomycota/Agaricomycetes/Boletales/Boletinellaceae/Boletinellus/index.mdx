## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Boletinellus merulioides_  
* **Authority & year:** Murrill, 1909  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized boletes, dry caps, yellow to olive pores, brown spore prints, often associated with ash trees  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Boletinellus** was established by **William Alphonso Murrill** in 1909. The name is a diminutive form of _Boletus_, suggesting a resemblance to true boletes but with distinct ecological and morphological traits.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Boletinellus** species stand out among boletes by their unusual features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry, smooth to cracked, typically colored tan, yellowish, or brownish.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to olive, sometimes bruising slightly but not blue.
  - Stipes are stout, solid, sometimes bulbous at the base.
  - Spore prints are olive-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, brown in deposit, ellipsoid to subfusiform.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include association with hardwoods (especially ashes), dry caps, and dull yellowish pore surfaces.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Boletinellus** as the core genus of Boletinellaceae, distantly related to true _Boletus_ species within Boletales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletales
 ├── Boletaceae
 ├── Gyroporaceae
 └── Boletinellaceae
      └── Boletinellus
```
The genus likely adapted early to saprotrophic and semi-symbiotic niches in temperate hardwood forests.

Key species:

- _Boletinellus merulioides_ (ash-tree bolete)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests and woodlands, particularly near ash trees; also found in open grasslands with scattered trees.
- **Substrates:** Soil; sometimes associated with root systems or aphid-inhabited ash roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Facultative symbiotic or saprotrophic; not a typical ectomycorrhizal fungus.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily eastern North America; scattered reports in Europe and Asia.

Species typically fruit in late summer and autumn, often appearing near ash trees (Fraxinus spp.).

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Boletinellus** fungi are ecologically intriguing though not major culinary mushrooms:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Boletinellus merulioides_ is technically edible but considered low quality due to spongy texture and bland flavor.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Unique for forming relationships with tree roots indirectly via symbiosis with aphids, creating beneficial soil conditions for fungal growth.
  - Plays a role in forest soil health and nutrient cycling.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for studies on alternative fungal symbioses (beyond traditional ectomycorrhizal models).
  - Highlights complex three-way interactions between plants, insects, and fungi.

Their unusual biology, affinity for ash trees, and distinctive fruitbodies make _Boletinellus_ a fascinating genus for mycologists and ecologists alike.
