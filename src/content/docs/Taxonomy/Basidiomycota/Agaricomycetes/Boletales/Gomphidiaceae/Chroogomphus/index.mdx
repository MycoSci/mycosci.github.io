## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Chroogomphus rutilus_  
* **Authority & year:** (Schaeff.) O.K. Miller, 1964  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gilled mushrooms, slimy to viscid caps, orange to coppery colors, gray to black spore prints, ectomycorrhizal with conifers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Chroogomphus** was erected by **Orson K. Miller Jr.** in 1964, separating certain colorful species from _Gomphidius_. The name combines Greek _chroa_ ("color") and _Gomphus_ ("nail" or "peg"), reflecting the typically vivid colors and somewhat peg-like fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Chroogomphus** species are brightly colored members of Gomphidiaceae:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly umbonate, viscid to slimy when moist, often copper, orange, reddish, or yellowish-brown.
  - Gills are thick, widely spaced, attached to slightly decurrent, grayish to blackish at maturity.
  - Stipes are central, often robust, colored similarly to or lighter than the cap.
  - Spore prints are smoky-gray to black.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, fusiform to ellipsoid, dark gray in mass.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include slimy caps, bright colors, thick gills, and gray-black spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) show that **Chroogomphus** forms a distinct lineage within Gomphidiaceae, separate from _Gomphidius_ (less vividly colored).

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Gomphidiaceae
 ├── Gomphidius
 ├── Chroogomphus
 └── Others
```
The genus likely diversified in association with coniferous forests during the late Tertiary period.

Important species include:

- _Chroogomphus rutilus_ (copper spike)
- _Chroogomphus ochraceus_
- _Chroogomphus vinicolor_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous forests, especially under pines, spruces, and firs.
- **Substrates:** Soil, often near roots of ectomycorrhizal hosts.
- **Trophic modes:** Thought to be parasitic on other ectomycorrhizal fungi (_e.g., Suillus_ species) rather than directly mycorrhizal themselves.

- **Geographic range:** Northern Hemisphere; Europe, North America, and parts of Asia.

Species typically fruit during summer and autumn, especially after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Chroogomphus** fungi are visually striking and occasionally consumed:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Chroogomphus rutilus_ and a few related species are edible after cooking, but flavor is generally considered mediocre.
  - Slimy texture when fresh can be off-putting.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Potentially important in complex fungal-fungal interactions, especially with _Suillus_ and ectomycorrhizal trees.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their unusual parasitic lifestyle and bright pigmentation.

Their coppery colors, slimy textures, and mysterious ecological roles make _Chroogomphus_ an intriguing and vivid genus among "gilled boletes."
