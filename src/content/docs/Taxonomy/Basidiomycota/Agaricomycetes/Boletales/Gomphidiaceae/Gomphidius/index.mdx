## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Gomphidius glutinosus_  
* **Authority & year:** Fr., 1836  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gilled fungi, thick glutinous (slimy) caps, grayish to blackish spore prints, ectomycorrhizal with conifers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Gomphidius** was formally described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1836. The name derives from Greek _gomphos_ ("nail" or "peg"), likely referring to the sturdy, peg-like stipes and substantial, slimy fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Gomphidius** species are distinctive among Boletales for their gilled structure:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, thickly viscid (very slimy when wet), colored gray, brown, pinkish, or violet.
  - Gills are thick, widely spaced, attached to slightly decurrent, starting pale and darkening to smoky-gray or blackish.
  - Stipes are stout, often slimy or viscid near the base, colored pale to matching the cap.
  - Spore prints are gray to blackish-gray.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, fusiform to ellipsoid, dark gray to black in deposit.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include glutinous caps, darkening thick gills, gray to black spore prints, and ectomycorrhizal ecology.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb1, rpb2) place **Gomphidius** within Gomphidiaceae, related to _Chroogomphus_ and other gilled "boletoid" fungi.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Gomphidiaceae
 ├── Gomphidius
 ├── Chroogomphus
 └── Others
```
The genus likely evolved from boletoid ancestors that secondarily developed gills for spore dispersal optimization.

Important species include:

- _Gomphidius glutinosus_ (slimy spike-cap)
- _Gomphidius smithii_
- _Gomphidius roseus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous forests, often under pines, spruces, and firs.
- **Substrates:** Soil near ectomycorrhizal host trees.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal or possibly semi-parasitic on Suillaceae fungi.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread across temperate zones in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species fruit in late summer and autumn, especially during wet periods.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Gomphidius** fungi are known among mushroom hunters and ecologists:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Gomphidius glutinosus_ is edible after thorough cooking; slimy texture may deter some people.
  - _Gomphidius roseus_ is less favored but not considered toxic.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important partners in coniferous forest ecosystems.
  - May be involved in complex ecological networks, interacting with other fungi as well as trees.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their peculiar gilled morphology within an otherwise pore-dominated fungal order.

Their slimy caps, gray spore prints, and close ties to conifers make _Gomphidius_ a fascinating transitional genus between typical boletes and gilled mushrooms.
