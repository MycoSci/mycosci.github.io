# Gomphidiaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Gomphidiaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Gomphidius glutinosus_ (for the type genus _Gomphidius_)  
* **Authority & year:** Maire, 1902  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gilled mushrooms with slimy caps, gray to blackish spore prints, ectomycorrhizal, related to boletes  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Gomphidiaceae** was formally established by **René Maire** in 1902 to group fungi with gills but closely related to the pore-bearing boletes (Boletales). The name comes from _Gomphidius_, meaning "nail-like," possibly referring to the pointed appearance of some species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Gomphidiaceae** fungi look like typical agarics but are genetically close to boletes:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flattened, often slimy or viscid when moist, colored gray, brown, yellowish, or purplish.
  - Gills are thick, widely spaced, decurrent (running down the stipe), grayish to blackish as spores mature.
  - Stipes are central, often slimy near the base.
  - Spore prints are gray to blackish.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, fusiform (spindle-shaped), dark gray to black in deposit.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include gray to black spore prints, slimy caps, thick gills, and ectomycorrhizal lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb1, rpb2) place **Gomphidiaceae** as a distinct lineage within Boletales, sister to pore-bearing boletes despite their gilled morphology.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletales
 ├── Boletaceae
 ├── Sclerodermataceae
 ├── Gomphidiaceae
 └── Others
```
The family likely evolved from boletoid ancestors, adapting to form gills as a secondary development.

Major genera include:

- _Gomphidius_ (slimy-capped species)
- _Chroogomphus_ (bright-colored slimy species)
- _Cystogomphus_ (rare, small species)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors under conifers (especially pines, spruces, and larches).
- **Substrates:** Soil, often closely associated with specific ectomycorrhizal tree species.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, facilitating nutrient exchange with trees.

- **Geographic range:** Temperate zones of North America, Europe, and Asia; especially abundant in coniferous forests.

Species often fruit after autumn rains, forming scattered to dense groups.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Gomphidiaceae** fungi are ecologically important and modestly known to foragers:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Gomphidius glutinosus_) are edible, but slimy textures and dark spore stains limit popularity.
  - _Chroogomphus rutilus_ (copper spike) is sometimes collected for food in Europe.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important symbionts of coniferous forests, supporting tree health and soil richness.
  - May engage in complex fungal-fungal interactions alongside other ectomycorrhizal fungi.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for insights into gill evolution within otherwise pore-bearing lineages.

Their slimy beauty, evolutionary oddities, and vital ecological partnerships make _Gomphidiaceae_ a fascinating family at the margins of the classic "bolete" world.
