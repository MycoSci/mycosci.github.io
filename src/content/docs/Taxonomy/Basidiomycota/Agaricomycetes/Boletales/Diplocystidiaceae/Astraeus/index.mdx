## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Astraeus hygrometricus_  
* **Authority & year:** Morgan, 1889  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Earthstars with thick rays, hygroscopic (open/close with humidity), brown powdery gleba, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Astraeus** was established by **Andrew Price Morgan** in 1889. The name comes from Greek _Astraios_ ("of the stars"), referencing the dramatic star-like opening of the fruiting body when mature and exposed to moisture.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Astraeus** species resemble earthstars but belong to Boletales rather than the true Geastrales:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are initially globose, becoming star-shaped as the outer layers split into thick, fleshy rays.
  - Inner spore sac (endoperidium) is leathery to brittle, containing brownish powdery spores.
  - The rays are hygroscopic — opening when moist and closing when dry.
  - Color ranges from pale brown to dark gray or black with maturity.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped to subglobose.
  - Spores are finely ornamented, brown in mass, globose to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include hygroscopic behavior, thick fleshy rays, and brown powdery gleba.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Astraeus** within Boletales (specifically related to Diplocystidiaceae and Sclerodermataceae), not in Geastrales as originally thought based solely on morphology.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

Boletales
 ├── Boletaceae
 ├── Sclerodermataceae
 ├── Diplocystidiaceae
 └── Astraeus lineage
```
The genus likely evolved adaptations for spore dispersal in dry, open environments where moisture availability fluctuates.

Important species include:

- _Astraeus hygrometricus_ (barometer earthstar)
- _Astraeus asiaticus_
- _Astraeus pteridis_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Sandy soils, dry grasslands, open forests, and pine barrens.
- **Substrates:** Soil with sparse vegetation; often near ectomycorrhizal trees (pines, oaks).
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal (unlike true saprotrophic earthstars).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found widely across North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.

Species often fruit during wet seasons, expanding their rays when moisture is available to disperse spores.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Astraeus** fungi are culturally and ecologically significant:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species are reportedly edible when young (_e.g., Astraeus hygrometricus_), though they are usually tough and not highly prized.
  - Mostly consumed in local traditions in parts of Asia (Thailand, Laos).

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important ectomycorrhizal partners, especially for pine and oak forests in nutrient-poor soils.
  - Their hygroscopic dispersal mechanism is an adaptation to fluctuating moisture environments.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their fascinating evolution of morphology (earthstar form) independently of Geastrales.
  - Serve as model organisms for studying drought adaptations in fungi.

Their beautiful star-like forms, ecological partnerships, and biogeographic importance make _Astraeus_ one of the most intriguing genera of "false earthstars."
