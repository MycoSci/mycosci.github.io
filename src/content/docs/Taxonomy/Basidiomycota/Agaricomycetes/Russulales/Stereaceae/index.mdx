# Stereaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Russulales › **Family:** Stereaceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Stereum hirsutum_ (for the type genus _Stereum_)  
* **Authority & year:** Pilát, 1930  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Crust-like to bracket fungi, smooth to wrinkled undersurfaces, leathery or papery textures, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Stereaceae** was established by **Albert Pilát** in 1930 to include fungi with crust-like or thin bracket fruitbodies, often resembling polypores but lacking true pores. The name derives from the Greek _stereos_ ("hard" or "firm"), referring to their tough textures.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Stereaceae** fungi are easily recognized among the crust and shelf fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are resupinate (crust-like), effused-reflexed (partly spreading with small caps), or small bracket-shaped.
  - Upper surfaces are smooth, hairy, or scaly; colors range from orange, brown, gray, to blackish.
  - Hymenophores are smooth, cracked, or slightly wrinkled (never poroid).
  - Texture is leathery, papery, or tough.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid.
  - Cystidia are usually absent.
  - Clamp connections are often present.

**Synapomorphies** include smooth hymenophores, tough or leathery textures, and white rot wood decay.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Stereaceae** within Russulales, distinct from polypores, crust fungi of Meruliaceae, and coral fungi of Auriscalpiaceae.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Russulales
 ├── Russulaceae
 ├── Hericiaceae
 └── Stereaceae
```
The family likely represents an evolutionary adaptation to dry and exposed wood decomposition niches.

Major genera:

- _Stereum_ (the type genus)
- _Aleurodiscus_ (sometimes included historically but placed separately today)
- _Xylobolus_ (related crust fungi)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead wood, bark, stumps, logs, and branches in forests and woodlands.
- **Substrates:** Primarily hardwoods, less commonly conifers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot by degrading lignin and cellulose.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found from temperate to tropical forests worldwide.

Species often fruit year-round and persist through dry or cold conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Stereaceae** fungi are important decomposers but little known to the general public:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are tough, thin, and insubstantial.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major contributors to the decomposition of bark and small woody debris.
  - Play a key role in the recycling of nutrients back into forest soils.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for wood decay mechanisms, enzymatic activity, and fungal succession on woody substrates.

Their understated presence, vital ecological role, and tough persistence across seasons make _Stereaceae_ a cornerstone family for maintaining healthy forest ecosystems.
