# Russulales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Russulales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Russula emetica_ (representing the type genus _Russula_)  
* **Authority & year:** Kreisel, 1969  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Brittle-fleshed gilled fungi, coral fungi, crust fungi, ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic, white spore prints common  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Russulales** was established by **Hanns Kreisel** in 1969. It is named after the genus _Russula_, one of the most characteristic and widely recognized groups of gilled mushrooms known for their brittle texture.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Russulales** includes a remarkable diversity of forms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruitbodies range from gilled mushrooms (agarics) to coral-like forms, crust fungi, and polypores.
  - _Russula_ and _Lactarius_ (milk-caps) are noted for their brittle flesh caused by the presence of sphaerocysts (rounded cells).
  - Many have white, cream, or pale spore prints, though some are ochre, yellow, or even ornamented.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are mostly four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are often ornamented (warty or reticulate) and amyloid (turning blue-black in Melzer’s reagent).
  - Clamp connections are generally absent.
  - Sphaerocysts are a diagnostic feature in _Russula_ and _Lactarius_.

**Synapomorphies** include amyloid ornamented spores, brittle fruitbody textures, and ectomycorrhizal relationships (in major genera).

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb1) confirm that **Russulales** forms a highly diverse and ancient clade distinct from the classic agaricales and polyporales.

Russulales exhibits an impressive radiation into various ecological niches, from forest floors to decaying wood.

Major families:

- _Russulaceae_ (brittlegills and milk-caps)
- _Auriscalpiaceae_ (toothed fungi)
- _Bondarzewiaceae_ (giant polypores)
- _Hericiaceae_ (coral fungi like _Hericium_)
- _Lachnocladiaceae_ (crust fungi)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Wide — includes forest floors, leaf litter, dead wood, living tree roots, and grassy areas.
- **Substrates:** Soil (ectomycorrhizal species), dead wood (saprotrophic species).
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal (symbiotic with trees) and saprotrophic (decomposing dead plant matter).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in temperate, tropical, and boreal forests across the world.

Species typically fruit from late spring through autumn, depending on rainfall.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Russulales** fungi are critically important both ecologically and culturally:

- **Edibility:**
  - Many species (_e.g., Russula cyanoxantha_, _Lactarius deliciosus_) are choice edibles.
  - Others (_e.g., Russula emetica_) are mildly to strongly toxic.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Dominant ectomycorrhizal fungi in many forest ecosystems, vital for tree health and nutrient cycling.
  - Important agents of wood decay and soil formation among saprotrophic members.

- **Scientific and cultural relevance:**
  - Rich traditions of mushroom foraging and use in Europe, Asia, and North America.
  - Model organisms for studies on fungal evolution, symbiosis, and fruitbody development.

Their stunning diversity, essential ecological roles, and prominent place in fungal evolution make _Russulales_ one of the cornerstone fungal orders in the world's forests.
