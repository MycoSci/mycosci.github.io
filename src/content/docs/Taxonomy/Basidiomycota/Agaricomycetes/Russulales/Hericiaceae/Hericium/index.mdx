## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hericium erinaceus_  
* **Authority & year:** Pers., 1797  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Cascading tooth fungi, white fleshy fruitbodies, hanging spines, white rot decomposers, edible and medicinal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Hericium** was described by **Christiaan Hendrik Persoon** in 1797. The name comes from Latin _hericius_ ("hedgehog"), referring to the spiny or bristly appearance of these fungi, resembling a hedgehog's coat.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hericium** species are among the most visually distinctive forest fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are globular to branched, forming tufts or cascading masses.
  - Surfaces are densely covered with long, soft, hanging spines or teeth (over 1 cm long in some species).
  - Coloration is bright white when fresh, fading to yellowish or brownish with age.
  - Flesh is firm yet delicate, especially when young.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, spherical to broadly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include long, hanging spines, soft white fruitbodies, and white rot enzymatic capabilities.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Hericium** within the Hericiaceae family of Russulales, closely related to other toothed fungi but distinct by its large, soft, and fleshy architecture.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Hericiaceae
 └── Hericium
```
The genus likely evolved specialized adaptations to maximize spore dispersal from hanging spines in moist forest environments.

Important species include:

- _Hericium erinaceus_ (lion’s mane)
- _Hericium coralloides_ (comb tooth fungus)
- _Hericium americanum_ (bear’s head tooth fungus)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead hardwood trunks, large logs, wounded living trees; often associated with beech, oak, and maple.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead or stressed living wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic and occasionally weakly parasitic.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread across North America, Europe, and Asia; cosmopolitan in temperate and boreal forests.

Species fruit from late summer into autumn, often appearing after heavy rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hericium** fungi are highly regarded both ecologically and culturally:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Hericium erinaceus_ and its relatives are **choice edible mushrooms**, valued for their delicate seafood-like flavor and tender texture.
  - Widely cultivated commercially and used in gourmet cooking.

- **Medicinal significance:**
  - Studied for compounds like hericenones and erinacines, which may promote nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, cognitive health, and immune support.
  - Increasingly used in supplements, teas, and functional foods.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major decomposers of large deadwood, crucial for nutrient recycling in mature forests.

Their elegant architecture, culinary and medicinal fame, and vital forest functions make _Hericium_ one of the most remarkable and celebrated genera in mycology.
