## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Auriscalpium vulgare_  
* **Authority & year:** Gray, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small, dark, spiny-toothed fungi, tough and leathery, white rot decomposers, often growing on pine cones  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Auriscalpium** was described by **Samuel Frederick Gray** in 1821. The name comes from Latin _auris_ ("ear") and _scalprum_ ("scraper"), likening the fruitbody’s shape to an ancient ear-cleaning tool.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Auriscalpium** species are tiny, tough fungi with unmistakable appearances:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are small, dark brown to blackish, centrally stalked with a round to spoon-shaped cap.
  - Undersurfaces bear dense, downward-pointing spines (teeth) instead of gills or pores.
  - Cap surfaces are dry, often hairy or velvety.
  - Texture is leathery to tough when mature.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, broadly ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include toothed hymenophores, dark-colored caps, small stature, and a tough texture adapted for exposed environments.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Auriscalpium** firmly within Auriscalpiaceae of Russulales, closely related to _Artomyces_ but distinguished by their solitary, unbranched fruitbodies and toothed undersides.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Auriscalpiaceae
 ├── Artomyces
 └── Auriscalpium
```
The genus likely evolved adaptations for fruiting on tough substrates like conifer cones.

Important species include:

- _Auriscalpium vulgare_ (the ear-pick fungus)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, especially among coniferous trees; often specifically on decaying pine cones or mossy wood.
- **Substrates:** Dead pine cones, fallen wood, needle litter.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot by degrading lignified tissues.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed in temperate forests across North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species fruit in late summer through autumn, favoring moist, shaded environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Auriscalpium** fungi are miniature ecological specialists:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are tough, small, and unpalatable.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical decomposers of conifer debris, aiding in recycling forest nutrients.
  - Their tough bodies persist long after spore release, providing habitat structure for microfauna.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - _Auriscalpium vulgare_ is a classic model for studying adaptations to specialized substrates like pine cones and the evolution of toothed hymenophores.

Their tiny yet durable beauty, ecological specialization, and ancient lineage make _Auriscalpium_ one of the most unique genera in forest ecosystems.
