# Auriscalpiaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Russulales › **Family:** Auriscalpiaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Auriscalpium vulgare_ (for the type genus _Auriscalpium_)  
* **Authority & year:** Maas Geest. & Nannf., 1971  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Toothed fungi, small to medium fruitbodies, dark-colored caps, tough or leathery textures, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Auriscalpiaceae** was established by **Rudolf Arnold Maas Geesteranus** and **John Axel Nannfeldt** in 1971 to accommodate certain small, spiny-toothed fungi that differ from classic gilled mushrooms and polypores. The name is derived from _Auriscalpium_ ("ear scraper"), a reference to the shape of the type species resembling an ancient ear-cleaning tool.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Auriscalpiaceae** fungi are distinct by their toothed hymenophores:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are small to medium-sized, with a centrally or eccentrically stalked cap.
  - Cap surfaces are dry, sometimes scaly or rough, usually dark brown to grayish.
  - Undersurfaces bear densely packed spines (teeth) instead of gills or pores.
  - Texture tough to leathery, especially when mature.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are usually absent.

**Synapomorphies** include toothed hymenophores, tough textures, and spore-producing spines instead of gills or pores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Auriscalpiaceae** within Russulales, separate from polypores and coral fungi, confirming its unique lineage among wood-decaying basidiomycetes.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Russulales
 ├── Russulaceae
 ├── Albatrellaceae
 └── Auriscalpiaceae
```
The family represents a specialized offshoot favoring wood decay through an alternative hymenophore structure (spines).

Primary genera:

- _Auriscalpium_ (type genus)
- _Lentinellus_ (sometimes associated historically but placed elsewhere)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Fallen conifer cones, decaying wood, forest litter.
- **Substrates:** Primarily on woody debris or pinecones (in the case of _Auriscalpium vulgare_).
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot by decomposing lignified tissues.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across temperate and boreal forests worldwide.

Species tend to fruit in late summer and autumn, often persisting into winter.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Auriscalpiaceae** fungi are ecologically important and charming in appearance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are small, tough, and unpalatable.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important for early-stage decomposition of small woody debris, including conifer cones.
  - Contribute to forest nutrient cycling and soil formation.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - _Auriscalpium vulgare_ is a classic example of alternative fruitbody evolution and is used in ecological and morphological research.

Their unusual spiny undersides, miniature stature, and key role in forest recycling make _Auriscalpiaceae_ a fascinating and vital fungal family.
