# Russulaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Russulales › **Family:** Russulaceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Russula emetica_ (for the type genus _Russula_)  
* **Authority & year:** Lotsy, 1907  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Brittle-fleshed mushrooms, white to ochre spore prints, ornamented amyloid spores, ectomycorrhizal with trees  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Russulaceae** was established by **Johannes Paulus Lotsy** in 1907 to encompass the distinctive brittle-fleshed gilled mushrooms. The name derives from the type genus _Russula_, meaning "red" in Latin, referencing the often colorful caps.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Russulaceae** fungi are iconic among forest mushrooms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are agaricoid (mushroom-shaped), with centrally positioned stipes and convex to depressed caps.
  - Flesh is brittle and crumbles like chalk when broken, due to spherical cells (sphaerocysts) in the tissue.
  - Cap colors are diverse — bright red, purple, yellow, green, brown, or white.
  - Gills are attached to free, often brittle.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are ornamented (warty or reticulate) and strongly amyloid (staining blue-black in Melzer’s reagent).
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include brittle flesh, amyloid ornamented spores, and largely ectomycorrhizal lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Russulaceae** as a monophyletic and ancient lineage within Russulales, distinct from crust fungi and toothed fungi.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Russulales
 └── Russulaceae
      ├── Russula
      └── Lactarius
```
The family is thought to have diversified alongside angiosperms and conifers, evolving complex ectomycorrhizal associations.

Major genera:

- _Russula_ (brittlegills)
- _Lactarius_ (milk-caps)
- _Multifurca_ (rare, intermediate forms)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Found in nearly all forest types, from tropical rainforests to boreal woodlands.
- **Substrates:** Soil near the roots of trees.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with a wide range of trees and shrubs.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; especially dominant in temperate and boreal forests.

Species fruit prolifically in summer and autumn, especially after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Russulaceae** fungi are among the most culturally and ecologically significant mushrooms:

- **Edibility:**
  - Many _Russula_ and _Lactarius_ species are edible and widely foraged (_e.g.,_ _Russula cyanoxantha_, _Lactarius deliciosus_).
  - Some are toxic (_e.g.,_ _Russula emetica_).

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical symbionts enhancing tree health, nutrient uptake, and forest ecosystem stability.
  - Contribute massively to forest soil structure and carbon cycling.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied extensively in mycorrhizal ecology, forest health, fungal evolution, and secondary metabolite chemistry (including milk-latex compounds in _Lactarius_).

Their stunning diversity, ecological keystone status, and rich cultural associations make _Russulaceae_ one of the most beloved and important fungal families.
