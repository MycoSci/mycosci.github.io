## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Russula emetica_  
* **Authority & year:** Pers., 1796  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Brittle-fleshed gilled mushrooms, brightly colored caps, white to ochre spore prints, ectomycorrhizal symbionts  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Russula** was described by **Christiaan Hendrik Persoon** in 1796. The name comes from Latin _russulus_ ("reddish"), referring to the often vivid red hues found among its many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Russula** species are iconic woodland mushrooms, famous for their vibrant colors and brittle texture:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are mushroom-shaped with convex, depressed, or funnel-shaped caps.
  - Caps are dry, smooth to slightly sticky, displaying a rainbow of colors (red, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, white).
  - Gills are white to cream, often brittle and prone to breaking.
  - Flesh is crumbly or chalk-like, snapping cleanly due to the presence of sphaerocysts.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are ornamented (warty or reticulate) and strongly amyloid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include brittle texture, amyloid ornamented spores, and gilled fruitbodies associated with ectomycorrhizal trees.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb2) show **Russula** as a monophyletic group within Russulaceae (Russulales), sister to _Lactarius_ and _Lactifluus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Russulaceae
 ├── Russula
 ├── Lactarius
 └── Lactifluus
```
The genus is one of the oldest and most diverse ectomycorrhizal mushroom groups, diverging alongside the evolution of modern forests.

Important species include:

- _Russula cyanoxantha_ (charcoal burner)
- _Russula emetica_ (the emetic russula)
- _Russula virescens_ (green-cracking russula)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors among leaf litter, moss, or humus; associated with a wide range of trees.
- **Substrates:** Soil, in symbiosis with tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Strictly ectomycorrhizal, forming mutualistic relationships with broadleaf and coniferous trees.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in temperate, boreal, and tropical forests worldwide.

Species fruit prolifically during warm, rainy seasons.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Russula** fungi are both culturally famous and ecologically critical:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Russula cyanoxantha, Russula virescens_) are highly prized edibles.
  - Others (_e.g., Russula emetica_) are toxic or extremely acrid and inedible.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key symbionts in forest ecosystems, aiding tree growth, nutrient uptake, and soil stability.
  - Major components of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities across the world.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Used as models in studies of fungal evolution, mycorrhizal ecology, spore ornamentation, and secondary metabolites.

Their stunning color diversity, critical ecological roles, and deep evolutionary history make _Russula_ one of the cornerstone genera of mycology and forest biology.
