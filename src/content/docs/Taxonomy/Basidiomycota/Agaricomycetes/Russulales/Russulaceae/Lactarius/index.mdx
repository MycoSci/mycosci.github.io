# Lactarius <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Russulales › **Family:** Russulaceae › **Genus:** Lactarius

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lactarius deliciosus_  
* **Authority & year:** Pers., 1797  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Brittle-fleshed mushrooms, milky latex exuded from gills, white rot decomposers, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Lactarius** was described by **Christiaan Hendrik Persoon** in 1797. The name comes from Latin _lac_ ("milk"), referring to the latex ("milk") exuded from the gills when cut or bruised — a defining feature of the group.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lactarius** species are easily recognized among woodland mushrooms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are agaricoid (mushroom-shaped) with convex to funnel-shaped caps.
  - Gills are attached to decurrent, often spaced, and exude milky latex when damaged.
  - Cap colors vary widely — orange, yellow, brown, green, blue, and even violet.
  - Flesh is brittle due to abundant spherical cells (sphaerocysts).

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are ornamented (warty to reticulate) and strongly amyloid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include latex production, brittle flesh, amyloid ornamented spores, and ectomycorrhizal associations.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Lactarius** within Russulaceae of Russulales. _Lactarius_ is closely related to _Russula_, but distinguished by latex exudation.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Russulaceae
 ├── Russula
 └── Lactarius
```
The genus likely diversified alongside the expansion of angiosperms and conifers during the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic.

Important species include:

- _Lactarius deliciosus_ (saffron milk cap)
- _Lactarius indigo_ (blue milk mushroom)
- _Lactarius deterrimus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors among coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed woods.
- **Substrates:** Soil, associating with tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Strictly ectomycorrhizal, forming mutualistic relationships with trees.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; especially abundant in temperate, boreal, and montane forests worldwide.

Species fruit prolifically during rainy periods in summer and autumn.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lactarius** fungi are beloved for both their culinary and ecological significance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Many species (_e.g., Lactarius deliciosus_) are prized edibles with rich flavors.
  - Some species are acrid or even mildly toxic (_e.g., Lactarius torminosus_), requiring careful identification.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical ectomycorrhizal symbionts promoting tree health, drought resistance, and nutrient uptake.
  - Essential members of forest ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and forest dynamics.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for latex chemistry, fungal evolution, and mycorrhizal symbiosis research.
  - Model systems for exploring fungal diversity and secondary metabolites.

Their colorful fruitbodies, forest symbiosis, and cultural culinary importance make _Lactarius_ one of the most recognized and loved genera among wild mushrooms.
