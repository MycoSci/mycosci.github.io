## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Heterobasidion annosum_  
* **Authority & year:** Bref., 1888  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Perennial bracket fungi, white to brown pore surfaces, causes root and butt rot, major forest pathogen  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Heterobasidion** was described by **Julius Oscar Brefeld** in 1888. The name means "different basidium," referring to variability in basidial morphology, a key microscopic feature in its early characterization.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Heterobasidion** fungi are important agents of wood decay, especially in conifer forests:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are perennial or annual, bracket-like, flattened, tough, often thin.
  - Upper surfaces are brownish to blackish, often concentrically zoned or cracked.
  - Pore surfaces are white to cream when young, aging to brownish.
  - Flesh is fibrous to corky.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are usually absent.

**Synapomorphies** include perennial bracket forms, white to brown pore surfaces, white rot decay, and strong pathogenicity toward tree roots.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Heterobasidion** within Bondarzewiaceae (Russulales), closely allied to _Bondarzewia_ but genetically distinct due to its pathogenic strategies and finer fruitbody structure.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Bondarzewiaceae
 ├── Bondarzewia
 └── Heterobasidion
```
The genus represents an evolutionary specialization toward parasitizing living trees, particularly through root systems.

Important species include:

- _Heterobasidion annosum_ (the root rot fungus)
- _Heterobasidion irregulare_ (North American species formerly grouped with _H. annosum_)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests, plantations, and parks with coniferous (pine, spruce, fir) and sometimes hardwood trees.
- **Substrates:** Living tree roots, stumps, and buried wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Parasitic and saprotrophic; primarily causing root and butt rot in trees.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across North America, Europe, and Asia; a major pathogen in both natural and managed forests.

Species can fruit year-round under favorable conditions but are often more visible in late summer and autumn.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Heterobasidion** fungi are highly significant economically and ecologically:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are tough, corky, and unpalatable.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major decomposers of dead wood but also destructive parasites of living trees.
  - Help create wildlife habitat after infected trees die and fall.

- **Economic relevance:**
  - _Heterobasidion annosum_ and _H. irregulare_ are among the most damaging forest pathogens, causing billions of dollars in timber losses annually.
  - Active research focuses on disease management strategies, including stump treatments and biological controls.

Their destructive capabilities, forest reshaping roles, and global economic impacts make _Heterobasidion_ one of the most critical genera in forest pathology.
