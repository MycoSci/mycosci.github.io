# Albatrellaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Russulales › **Family:** Albatrellaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Albatrellus ovinus_ (for the type genus _Albatrellus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Lotsy, 1907  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Fleshy polypores, centrally stalked or sessile, small round pores, white rot agents  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Albatrellaceae** was established by **Johannes Paulus Lotsy** in 1907. It was created to recognize polypore fungi that are fleshy rather than tough or woody, sharing ecological and anatomical traits distinct from the classic shelf polypores.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Albatrellaceae** fungi are notable for their soft, mushroom-like appearances:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are fleshy to leathery, often centrally stalked but sometimes laterally attached.
  - Caps are smooth, dry, and colored white, tan, pinkish, or yellowish.
  - Hymenophores are poroid, with small round pores on the underside.
  - Flesh is thick, firm, and typically white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are present.

**Synapomorphies** include fleshy, centrally stalked polypores with small round pores and white rot enzymatic capabilities.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm that **Albatrellaceae** belongs in Russulales (not Polyporales as once thought), closely allied with _Russulaceae_ based on early-diverging agaricomycete lineages.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

The family represents a fascinating evolutionary blend of polypore-like morphology with brittle flesh characteristics found elsewhere in Russulales.

Major genera:

- _Albatrellus_ (the core genus)
- _Jahnoporus_
- _Scutiger_ (sometimes separated)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, among moss, near conifers or hardwoods, often associated with ectomycorrhizal partners.
- **Substrates:** Soil or occasionally decaying wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal and/or saprotrophic (depending on species).

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across temperate forests in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species often fruit late in the growing season, from summer into autumn.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Albatrellaceae** fungi are ecologically significant and occasionally edible:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Albatrellus ovinus_) are considered edible when young and tender.
  - Others are too tough or bitter.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key players in forest soil ecosystems, supporting tree nutrient acquisition through ectomycorrhizal symbiosis or decomposing organic matter.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for understanding fungal transitions between polypore and agaric morphologies.
  - Studied for pigment production (_e.g., Albatrellus flettii_ produces striking blue pigments).

Their unusual blend of cap-and-stipe structure, polypore pores, and forest floor roles make _Albatrellaceae_ one of the more fascinating small families within the Russulales.
