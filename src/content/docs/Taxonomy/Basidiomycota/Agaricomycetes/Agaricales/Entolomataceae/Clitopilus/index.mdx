# Clitopilus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Entolomataceae › **Genus:** Clitopilus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Clitopilus prunulus_  
* **Authority & year:** (Scopoli) P. Kummer, 1871  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Pink spore prints, decurrent gills, angular to elongate spores, saprotrophic, often fragrant  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Clitopilus** was established by **Paul Kummer** in 1871, elevating a group formerly placed in _Agaricus_ by **Giovanni Antonio Scopoli**. The name combines _clito-_ (referring to the sloping or decurrent gills) and _pilus_ ("cap"), describing the typical mushroom morphology. Recent molecular studies have upheld _Clitopilus_ as a distinct genus within Entolomataceae, separate from _Entoloma_ despite some morphological similarities.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Clitopilus** species show consistent and practical identification features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are small to medium-sized with a fleshy cap.
  - Gills are deeply decurrent (running down the stipe).
  - Spore print is pink to salmon-colored.
  - Some species have a distinctive floury or cucumber-like odor (_Clitopilus prunulus_).

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, producing four spores.
  - Spores are pink, elongate to angular, smooth-walled.
  - Cystidia may be present and useful for species differentiation.

**Synapomorphies** include pink spore prints, decurrent gills, and elongate-angular spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Clitopilus** as a distinct lineage within Entolomataceae, sister to the large _Entoloma_ clade.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Entolomataceae
 ├── Entoloma
 ├── Clitopilus
 ├── Rhodocybe
 └── Richoniella
```
_Clitopilus_ likely diversified alongside the expansion of temperate forests and grasslands during the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic.

Important species include:

- _Clitopilus prunulus_ (the miller)
- _Clitopilus hobsonii_
- _Clitopilus passeckerianus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist woodlands, grasslands, mossy areas, and forest edges.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in leaf litter, decaying plant debris, moss-covered ground.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing dead organic matter.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia.

Many species fruit in late summer to autumn after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Clitopilus** fungi have modest but important cultural and ecological roles:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Clitopilus prunulus_ ("the miller") is considered an excellent edible mushroom when properly identified.
  - Caution is needed because of potential confusion with toxic _Clitocybe_ species.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers in woodland and grassland ecosystems.
  - Contribute to nutrient cycling and soil health.

- **Research interest:**
  - _Clitopilus passeckerianus_ is studied industrially as a natural producer of pleuromutilin, a precursor to semi-synthetic antibiotics.

- **Cautionary notes:**
  - Field identification must be careful: some lookalikes (especially white-spored _Clitocybe_ species) are poisonous.

Their pleasant aroma and pink spore prints make _Clitopilus_ a favorite among mushroom hunters who know how to identify them carefully.
