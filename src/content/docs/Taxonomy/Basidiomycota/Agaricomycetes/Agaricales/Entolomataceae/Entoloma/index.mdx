## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Entoloma sinuatum_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) P. Kummer, 1871  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Pink spore prints, angular (polyhedral) spores, varied gill attachment, saprotrophic and mycorrhizal lifestyles  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Entoloma** was elevated to its modern understanding by **Paul Kummer** in 1871, based on earlier work by **Elias Magnus Fries**. The name derives from Greek _entos_ ("within") and _loma_ ("edge" or "border"), possibly referring to the characteristic inward curving gill edges seen in many species. _Entoloma_ represents one of the largest genera of pink-spored agarics.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Entoloma** species are remarkably diverse but share key diagnostic features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruitbodies range from small and delicate to large and robust.
  - Cap shapes vary — convex, conical, depressed, bell-shaped, or flat.
  - Gills are attached (adnexed, adnate, or sinuate) and become pinkish with maturity.
  - Spore print is pink to salmon-pink.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically bearing four spores.
  - Spores are angular, polyhedral, or irregular in shape, a hallmark of the genus.
  - Cheilocystidia and pileocystidia are often present and diagnostically useful.

**Synapomorphies** include pink spore prints and characteristically angular spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) have revealed that **Entoloma** is monophyletic when broad former genera (_Nolanea_, _Leptonia_, _Inocephalus_) are treated as subgroups rather than separate genera.

The diversification of _Entoloma_ is linked to the development of temperate grasslands and forests in the Cenozoic era.

Important species include:

- _Entoloma sinuatum_ (poisonous; type species)
- _Entoloma abortivum_ (edible when in parasitized form)
- _Entoloma hochstetteri_ (brilliant blue mushroom from New Zealand)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Wide-ranging — forests, grasslands, heathlands, wood edges, mossy areas.
- **Substrates:** Soil, leaf litter, moss, decaying organic matter.
- **Trophic modes:**
  - Mostly saprotrophic, decomposing organic material.
  - Some species are ectomycorrhizal, forming mutualistic associations with trees.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; extremely diverse in temperate and tropical regions.

Some species are highly specific to particular soil types, climates, or ecological niches.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Entoloma** fungi are important ecologically but must be approached with caution culturally:

- **Edibility and toxicity:**
  - Many species are poisonous (_Entoloma sinuatum_ causes serious gastrointestinal illness).
  - A few are edible (_Entoloma abortivum_ when parasitized by _Armillaria_), but caution is advised due to risk of misidentification.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key decomposers in grassland and forest ecosystems.
  - Important indicators of grassland conservation status (e.g., Entoloma-rich waxcap grasslands).

- **Cultural significance:**
  - _Entoloma hochstetteri_ (sky-blue entoloma) is famously depicted on New Zealand currency.

Because of their sheer diversity, beautiful colors, and complex spore shapes, _Entoloma_ species are a major focus in fungal taxonomy and conservation biology.
