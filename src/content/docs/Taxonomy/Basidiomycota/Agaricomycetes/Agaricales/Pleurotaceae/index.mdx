# Pleurotaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Pleurotaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Pleurotus ostreatus_ (for the type genus _Pleurotus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Kühner, 1926  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium to large wood-inhabiting mushrooms, laterally attached stipes, white to lilac spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Pleurotaceae** was established by **Robert Kühner** in 1926 to group a collection of laterally-stiped, gilled mushrooms primarily characterized by their wood-decomposing habits. The name comes from Greek _pleura_ ("side") and _-otus_ ("ear"), referring to the lateral, ear-like growth of many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Pleurotaceae** fungi are robust and often fan- or oyster-shaped:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are typically fan-shaped, oyster-shaped, or kidney-shaped, often with smooth surfaces.
  - Colors vary widely: white, gray, brown, tan, or even pink or yellow in cultivated forms.
  - Gills are decurrent (running down the stipe) and usually closely spaced.
  - Stipes are often lateral, reduced, or even absent.
  - Spore prints are white to lilac.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include wood-inhabiting, lateral attachment, decurrent gills, and pale spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) strongly support **Pleurotaceae** as a monophyletic family within Agaricales, distinct from Omphalotaceae and Marasmiaceae.

Major genera include:

- _Pleurotus_ (oyster mushrooms)
- _Hohenbuehelia_ (smaller, gelatinous species with hunting hyphae)
- _Resupinatus_ (small, resupinate to cup-like fungi)

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

Agaricales
 ├── Omphalotaceae
 └── Pleurotaceae
      ├── Pleurotus
      ├── Hohenbuehelia
      └── Resupinatus
```
The family likely diversified with the spread of forests during the Cenozoic, specializing in decomposing dead hardwood.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead logs, stumps, fallen branches, and living but weakened trees.
- **Substrates:** Primarily hardwoods, sometimes conifers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic (wood decay) and sometimes weakly parasitic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widely distributed across temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions.

Species often fruit prolifically after rains, especially in humid environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Pleurotaceae** fungi are among the most important edible and cultivated mushrooms worldwide:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Pleurotus ostreatus_ (oyster mushroom) and related species are highly prized edibles for their tender texture, mild flavor, and ease of cultivation.
  - Oyster mushrooms are widely farmed on agricultural byproducts (straw, sawdust, coffee grounds).

- **Medicinal properties:**
  - Rich in polysaccharides (e.g., β-glucans) and compounds with antioxidant, cholesterol-lowering, and immune-enhancing properties.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Vital decomposers of lignin-rich plant materials, promoting nutrient cycling and forest health.
  - Some _Hohenbuehelia_ species even prey on nematodes, helping to control soil pathogens.

- **Cultural significance:**
  - Featured in global cuisines, food security initiatives, and eco-friendly farming technologies.

Their combination of culinary, ecological, and biotechnological importance makes Pleurotaceae one of the most valued fungal families.
