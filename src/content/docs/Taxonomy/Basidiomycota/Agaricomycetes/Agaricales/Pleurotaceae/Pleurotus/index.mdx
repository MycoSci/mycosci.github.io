**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Pleurotaceae › **Genus:** Pleurotus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Pleurotus ostreatus_  
* **Authority & year:** (Jacquin) P. Kummer, 1871  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium to large fan-shaped mushrooms, lateral to absent stipes, decurrent gills, white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Pleurotus** was formalized by **Paul Kummer** in 1871, based on earlier descriptions by **Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin**. The name derives from Greek _pleura_ ("side") and _otus_ ("ear"), referencing the often laterally attached, ear-like or oyster-shaped fruitbodies that characterize the group.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Pleurotus** species are known for their iconic "oyster mushroom" form:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are fan-shaped to kidney-shaped, smooth, often overlapping in dense clusters.
  - Colors vary widely: white, cream, gray, brown, pink, yellow, and even blue in cultivated varieties.
  - Gills are decurrent, broad, and closely spaced.
  - Stipes are lateral, rudimentary, or absent; when present, off-center.
  - Spore prints are white to lilac.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are common at hyphal septa.

**Synapomorphies** include lateral attachment, decurrent gills, white spore prints, and fleshy, overlapping fruitbodies on wood.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Pleurotus** at the heart of Pleurotaceae, distinct from _Hohenbuehelia_ and _Resupinatus_, though sharing a common saprotrophic ancestor.

Pleurotaceae
 ├── Pleurotus

_Pleurotus_ likely diversified along with the expansion of hardwood forests during the Cenozoic, adapting to decomposing a wide range of woody substrates.

Important species include:

- _Pleurotus ostreatus_ (oyster mushroom)
- _Pleurotus pulmonarius_ (phoenix oyster)
- _Pleurotus eryngii_ (king oyster mushroom)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead or dying hardwoods (sometimes conifers), fallen logs, tree stumps, forest debris.
- **Substrates:** Primarily woody material, but some species adapt to herbaceous debris or artificial substrates.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, and in some cases weakly parasitic on living trees.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions worldwide.

Species often fruit in overlapping clusters, particularly after rains during cool seasons.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Pleurotus** fungi are among the most economically important mushrooms globally:

- **Edibility:**
  - Species like _P. ostreatus_, _P. pulmonarius_, and _P. eryngii_ are major commercial edibles.
  - Known for their tender texture, mild umami flavor, and versatility in cooking.

- **Cultivation:**
  - Oyster mushrooms are cultivated on diverse substrates (e.g., straw, sawdust, coffee grounds, paper waste).
  - Important for sustainable agriculture and food security initiatives.

- **Medicinal and nutritional benefits:**
  - Rich in protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
  - Contain bioactive compounds (e.g., β-glucans) with antioxidant, immune-modulating, and cholesterol-lowering properties.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Decompose tough lignocellulosic material, facilitating nutrient recycling in forest ecosystems.
  - Some _Pleurotus_ species are being explored for **mycoremediation** — the use of fungi to degrade environmental pollutants.

Their culinary excellence, ecological role, and sustainable cultivation potential make _Pleurotus_ one of the most celebrated fungal genera worldwide.
