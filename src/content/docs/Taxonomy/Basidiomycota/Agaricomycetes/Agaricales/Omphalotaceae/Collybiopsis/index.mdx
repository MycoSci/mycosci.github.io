## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Collybiopsis peronata_  
* **Authority & year:** R.H. Petersen, 2010  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small wood-inhabiting mushrooms, tough stipes, white spore prints, often with hairy stipe bases  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Collybiopsis** was established by **Ronald H. Petersen** in 2010 during revisions of _Collybia_-like fungi, based on distinct molecular and morphological features. The name means "resembling _Collybia_," reflecting the small, robust fruitbodies that somewhat resemble those of _Collybia_ but differ significantly at the microscopic and genetic levels.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Collybiopsis** species display a combination of sturdy form and delicate features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are small, convex to flattened, often whitish to buff or pale brown.
  - Stipes are tough, wiry, and often feature a distinctive hairy or tomentose (fuzzy) base.
  - Gills are attached to slightly decurrent, whitish, becoming slightly creamy with age.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid to broadly oval.
  - Cheilocystidia are present and useful for species differentiation.

**Synapomorphies** include small size, white spore prints, tough wiry stipes with hairy bases, and wood-associated habitats.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Collybiopsis** securely within Omphalotaceae, separated from true _Collybia_, _Gymnopus_, and other formerly allied genera.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Omphalotaceae
 ├── Omphalotus
 ├── Collybiopsis
 └── Others
```
The genus likely evolved to specialize in decomposing fine woody debris and small fallen branches in forest ecosystems.

Important species include:

- _Collybiopsis peronata_ (the "hairy-footed collybiopsis")
- _Collybiopsis luxurians_
- _Collybiopsis pilosa_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Decaying woody debris, fallen twigs, mossy logs, forest litter.
- **Substrates:** Dead wood, bark, and sometimes attached to mossy ground.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down woody material and contributing to nutrient cycling.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread; found in temperate and tropical forests across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia.

Species often fruit in humid conditions, forming small, scattered or densely clustered colonies.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Collybiopsis** fungi, while small, play important ecological roles:

- **Edibility:**
  - Generally considered inedible due to small size and tough, fibrous texture.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Efficient decomposers of woody debris, supporting soil formation and forest ecosystem dynamics.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for understanding fungal diversity and specialization in wood decomposition.
  - Their molecular placement helped clarify relationships within Omphalotaceae and the broader Agaricales.

Although inconspicuous, _Collybiopsis_ species are crucial recyclers in forest ecosystems and exemplify the hidden biodiversity of small wood-inhabiting fungi.
