# Lentinula <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Omphalotaceae › **Genus:** Lentinula

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lentinula edodes_  
* **Authority & year:** (Berk.) Pegler, 1983  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized wood-inhabiting mushrooms, brownish caps, white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Lentinula** was formally defined by **David Pegler** in 1983 after taxonomic reevaluation of several lignicolous species. The name references its earlier placement with _Lentinus_ (now mostly polypores), but _Lentinula_ species are true gilled mushrooms, characterized by softer, fleshy textures and distinct molecular traits.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lentinula** species are notable for their robust yet soft features and wood decay abilities:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are fleshy, convex to flattened, often brownish, tan, or gray, and can be scaly or cracked with age.
  - Gills are white to cream, attached to slightly decurrent.
  - Stipes are central to slightly off-center, firm but often softer than those of classic wood-decay fungi.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are common at the bases of basidia.

**Synapomorphies** include fleshy caps with gills (not pores), white spores, and wood-inhabiting saprotrophic habits.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Lentinula** within Omphalotaceae, closely related to _Omphalotus_ and _Gymnopus_ but clearly distinct.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Omphalotaceae
 ├── Omphalotus
 ├── Gymnopus
 ├── Lentinula
 └── Connopus
```
_Lentinula_ species likely evolved alongside hardwood-dominated forests, specializing in the decomposition of dead logs and stumps.

Important species include:

- _Lentinula edodes_ (shiitake mushroom)
- _Lentinula boryana_
- _Lentinula lateritia_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forested environments, especially with abundant dead hardwood.
- **Substrates:** Fallen logs, dead stumps, woody debris, primarily hardwoods like oak, beech, and chestnut.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing lignified wood.

- **Geographic range:** Mainly East Asia, tropical Americas, and parts of Australasia; now widely cultivated worldwide.

Species fruit naturally after heavy rainfall, often during warm, humid seasons.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lentinula** fungi are ecologically vital and economically significant:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Lentinula edodes_ ("shiitake") is one of the most cultivated and consumed edible mushrooms worldwide, valued for its savory (umami) flavor and health benefits.
  - Shiitakes are traditionally grown on hardwood logs or artificial sawdust substrates.

- **Economic importance:**
  - Shiitake cultivation is a major agricultural industry in East Asia and increasingly globally, contributing billions to the food sector.

- **Medicinal properties:**
  - _Lentinula edodes_ contains compounds like lentinan (a β-glucan) with immunomodulatory and anticancer properties, extensively studied in modern pharmacology.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Plays a key role in forest wood decomposition, facilitating nutrient recycling.

Their combination of ecological role, culinary excellence, and medicinal promise makes _Lentinula_ one of the most celebrated fungal genera.
