## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Marasmiellus candidus_  
* **Authority & year:** Murrill, 1915  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Tiny to small mushrooms, tough wiry stipes, pale to brightly colored caps, white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Marasmiellus** was described by **William Alphonso Murrill** in 1915 to accommodate small, tough mushrooms previously lumped within _Marasmius_. The name means "little Marasmius," reflecting both its small size and its close morphological resemblance to that genus while being phylogenetically distinct.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Marasmiellus** species have field characteristics that combine toughness and small size:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are tiny to small, convex to flattened, dry or slightly hygrophanous.
  - Colors range from white, cream, yellow, pink, to pale brown.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to adnexed) and often widely spaced.
  - Stipes are slender, wiry, often tough and elastic.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid to pip-shaped.
  - Cheilocystidia are often well-developed and important for species-level ID.

**Synapomorphies** include tough, wiry stems, white spore prints, and saprotrophic lifestyles on plant debris and wood.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Marasmiellus** within Omphalotaceae, distinct from _Marasmius_ and _Gymnopus_, with a unique evolutionary path among saprotrophic agarics.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Omphalotaceae
 ├── Omphalotus
 ├── Gymnopus
 ├── Marasmiellus
 └── Lentinula
```
The genus likely diversified in warm, moist environments with abundant decaying plant material.

Important species include:

- _Marasmiellus candidus_
- _Marasmiellus ramealis_
- _Marasmiellus troyanus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Tropical and temperate forests, grasslands, gardens, woodlands, mossy areas.
- **Substrates:** Leaf litter, twigs, dead herbaceous stems, fallen branches, decomposing wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, specializing in the decomposition of dead organic plant material.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widely distributed but especially rich in tropical and subtropical regions.

Species are often found fruiting after rains, rapidly colonizing fresh plant litter.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Marasmiellus** fungi are modest in size but ecologically important:

- **Edibility:**
  - Generally not collected for food due to small size and tough texture.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Crucial agents of organic matter decomposition in tropical and subtropical ecosystems.
  - Help recycle nutrients and maintain healthy forest soil dynamics.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important subjects for studying saprotrophic life cycles and fungal community ecology in leaf litter systems.

Their diminutive forms and rapid decomposition abilities make _Marasmiellus_ a key genus among tropical and temperate forest litter fungi.
