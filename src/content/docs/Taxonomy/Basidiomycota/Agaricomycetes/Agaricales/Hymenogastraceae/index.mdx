# Hymenogastraceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Hymenogastraceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hymenogaster citrinus_ (for the type genus _Hymenogaster_)  
* **Authority & year:** Vittadini, 1842  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Dark-spored agarics and gasteroid forms, earthy or musky odors, saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Hymenogastraceae** was formally established by **Carlo Vittadini** in 1842, based on the gasteroid (truffle-like) genus _Hymenogaster_. The name refers to "hymenium-bearing stomachs," describing the enclosed spore-bearing structures of early-known members. Modern molecular studies expanded Hymenogastraceae to include several gilled mushrooms traditionally placed elsewhere, emphasizing evolutionary relationships beyond morphology alone.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hymenogastraceae** is morphologically diverse, including both agaricoid and gasteroid species:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies vary from classic mushroom forms to truffle-like, enclosed structures.
  - Caps in agarics are often dry to moist, with earthy colors (brown, yellow-brown, gray).
  - Spore prints range from brown to dark purplish-brown.
  - Odors can be farinaceous (mealy), musky, or unpleasant in some species.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically bearing four spores.
  - Spores are smooth to roughened, brown, ellipsoid to amygdaliform (almond-shaped).
  - Clamp connections are variable.

**Synapomorphies** include brown spore prints, terrestrial habits, and the presence of both gilled and gasteroid forms within a monophyletic group.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2) confirm **Hymenogastraceae** as a distinct and diverse family within Agaricales, closely related to _Strophariaceae_.

Major genera within Hymenogastraceae include:

- _Hebeloma_ (poison pies)
- _Gymnopilus_ (rustgills)
- _Hymenogaster_ (gasteroid fungi)
- _Psilocybe_ (psilocybin mushrooms, partially placed here after reclassification)

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricales
 ├── Strophariaceae
 ├── Hymenogastraceae
      ├── Hebeloma
      ├── Gymnopilus
      ├── Hymenogaster
      └── Psilocybe
```
The family likely diversified during the Cretaceous and Cenozoic, adapting to symbiotic and saprotrophic lifestyles in forests and grasslands.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, meadows, grasslands, disturbed soils, and mossy areas.
- **Substrates:** Soil, decaying organic matter, wood debris.
- **Trophic modes:**
  - Saprotrophic (decomposing dead organic material).
  - Ectomycorrhizal (especially _Hebeloma_ species).
  - Some species are specialized on dung or decaying plant matter.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; especially diverse in temperate forests, tropical montane regions, and open grasslands.

Species can fruit singly, in troops, or scattered widely, often appearing after rain.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hymenogastraceae** fungi are ecologically vital and culturally significant:

- **Edibility and toxicity:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Hebeloma crustuliniforme_) are poisonous.
  - _Gymnopilus_ species can be psychoactive due to compounds like psilocybin.
  - _Psilocybe_ species are famed for their psychoactive properties but require careful legal and ethical considerations.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key decomposers and ectomycorrhizal partners in forest ecosystems.
  - Important in soil stabilization and organic matter recycling.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - _Psilocybe_ mushrooms have deep significance in indigenous ritual contexts and modern research into mental health therapies.
  - _Gymnopilus_ and _Hebeloma_ are often featured in mushroom field guides due to their ubiquity and striking appearances.

Their combination of ecological function, scientific interest, and cultural visibility makes Hymenogastraceae an essential family in fungal biodiversity studies.
