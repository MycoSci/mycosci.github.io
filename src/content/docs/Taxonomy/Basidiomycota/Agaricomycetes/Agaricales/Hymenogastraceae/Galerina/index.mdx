## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Galerina marginata_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) P. Karsten, 1879  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small brown mushrooms, brown spore prints, saprotrophic on wood, some deadly toxic species  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Galerina** was first described by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1879, building on earlier work by **Elias Magnus Fries**. The name comes from Latin _galerus_ ("hat" or "helmet"), a reference to the small, cap-like fruiting bodies. Galerina includes many tiny, brown, wood-inhabiting species that are often mistaken for harmless "little brown mushrooms" (LBMs), yet some are dangerously toxic.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Galerina** species are delicate but diverse, unified by certain key features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are small to very small, with convex to bell-shaped caps.
  - Colors range from honey-brown, tan, cinnamon, to ochre.
  - Stipes are slender, often brittle, and can have a faint ring (or ring zone).
  - Spore prints are rusty-brown to cinnamon-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are ornamented (roughened or warty), brown, often with a germ pore.
  - Cheilocystidia are common and variable; useful for species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include small size, brown spore prints, ornamented spores, and wood-decaying lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Galerina** within Hymenogastraceae, related to genera like _Hebeloma_ and _Gymnopilus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

 └── Psilocybe

Within _Galerina_, various species groups exist, including the highly toxic _Galerina marginata_ complex.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Decaying wood, mossy logs, forest litter, peat bogs, moss mats, and occasionally soil.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead wood and mossy substrates.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing woody and organic debris.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found worldwide in forests, woodlands, tundras, and moist grasslands.

Species can fruit prolifically after rain, especially in cool, moist environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Galerina** fungi are critically important for ecological and public safety reasons:

- **Toxicity:**
  - Several species, particularly _Galerina marginata_ (formerly _Galerina autumnalis_), are deadly toxic due to amatoxins, the same compounds found in _Amanita phalloides_ (death cap).
  - Mistaking a toxic _Galerina_ for an edible mushroom (e.g., _Psilocybe_ or _Flammulina_) can be fatal.

- **Ecological role:**
  - Important decomposers of lignocellulosic materials, playing a key role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Some species are sensitive to forest degradation and can serve as indicators of undisturbed woodland habitats.

**Galerina** stands as a genus where small size belies great ecological importance—and potential danger to the unwary forager.
