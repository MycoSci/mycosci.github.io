## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Gymnopilus penetrans_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) P. Karsten, 1879  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Rusty-orange to golden-brown mushrooms, fibrous flesh, bitter taste, brown spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Gymnopilus** was described by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1879, following initial classifications by **Elias Magnus Fries**. The name derives from Greek _gymnos_ ("naked") and _pilos_ ("cap"), possibly referring to the often dry, scaly caps without a universal veil. _Gymnopilus_ is known for its robust, often brightly colored mushrooms and includes species with ecological, culinary, and psychoactive significance.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Gymnopilus** species are often large, tough, and vividly colored:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are dry to scaly, often bright orange, yellow, or rusty brown.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to decurrent) and change color as spores mature.
  - Stipes are sturdy, often fibrous or woody, sometimes ringed.
  - Spore prints are rusty-orange to brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are roughened (warty or verrucose), rusty-brown, and thick-walled.
  - Cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia vary and are important for identification.

**Synapomorphies** include rusty spore prints, roughened spores, and brightly colored, fibrous basidiocarps.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Gymnopilus** as a distinct genus within Hymenogastraceae, related to _Galerina_, _Hebeloma_, and _Psilocybe_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Hymenogastraceae
 ├── Hebeloma
 ├── Hymenogaster
 ├── Galerina
 ├── Psilocybe
 └── Gymnopilus
```
The genus diversified with the expansion of woody habitats during the Cenozoic, exploiting dead wood and lignified plant materials.

Important species include:

- _Gymnopilus junonius_ (laughing gym)
- _Gymnopilus sapineus_
- _Gymnopilus luteofolius_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests, woodlands, swamps, grasslands — anywhere with abundant decaying wood or woody debris.
- **Substrates:** Dead wood, stumps, buried roots, occasionally sawdust or mulch.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing lignin-rich materials.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found across temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions.

Species often fruit prolifically in clusters on logs or stumps after rain.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Gymnopilus** fungi have a mixed reputation culturally:

- **Edibility and psychoactivity:**
  - Most species are too bitter to be considered edible.
  - Some species (e.g., _Gymnopilus luteofolius_, _G. junonius_) contain psychoactive compounds like psilocybin and psilocin, though concentrations are variable.
  - Identification must be approached with caution due to variability and confusion with other rusty-spored fungi.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major decomposers of hardwood and conifer debris, contributing to forest nutrient cycling.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Psychedelic species have drawn attention from mycologists, ethnobotanists, and recreational users alike.

Their toughness, brilliant colors, and complex chemistry make _Gymnopilus_ an important genus in fungal ecology, toxicology, and psychopharmacology.
