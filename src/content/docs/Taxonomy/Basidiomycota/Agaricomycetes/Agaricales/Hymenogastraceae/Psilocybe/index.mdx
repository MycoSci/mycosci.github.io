## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Psilocybe semilanceata_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) P. Kummer, 1871  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized mushrooms, brown to purplish-brown spore prints, blue-staining on bruising, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Psilocybe** was formalized by **Paul Kummer** in 1871, following earlier work by **Elias Magnus Fries**. The name derives from Greek _psilos_ ("bare" or "naked") and _cybe_ ("head"), referring to the typically smooth, conical to bell-shaped caps. _Psilocybe_ is most famous for containing species with psychoactive compounds like psilocybin and psilocin.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Psilocybe** species are highly recognizable among small brown mushrooms by key features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are usually conical to bell-shaped, often hygrophanous (changing color as they dry).
  - Colors vary from caramel, brown, to olive when moist, fading as they dry.
  - Stipes are slender, often white to brownish, sometimes with a fragile annulus or cortina-like zone.
  - Spore prints are purple-brown to dark purplish-black.
  - Many species bruise blue when handled, a key field characteristic linked to psilocybin oxidation.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, thick-walled, purple-brown in deposit, and often subellipsoid to subrhomboid.
  - Cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia are diverse in form and important for species differentiation.

**Synapomorphies** include purple-brown spore prints, blue bruising in many species, and typically small, hygrophanous caps.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) have clarified **Psilocybe** sensu stricto (blue-staining species with psilocybin) and separated non-blue-staining _Psilocybe_ species (now often placed in _Deconica_).

_Psilocybe_ likely diversified during the Cenozoic, especially in grasslands, woodlands, and dung-enriched soils.

Key species include:

- _Psilocybe semilanceata_ (liberty cap)
- _Psilocybe cubensis_ (golden teacher)
- _Psilocybe cyanescens_ (wavy cap)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, pastures, forest floors, wood chips, and disturbed soils.
- **Substrates:** Rich organic soils, decaying wood, dung (especially in tropical species).
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing plant debris and organic matter.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; species distributed across temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions.

Species often fruit after rains and cooler temperatures, particularly in autumn.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Psilocybe** fungi are globally important for their psychoactive and cultural roles:

- **Psychoactivity:**
  - Many species contain psilocybin, psilocin, and related compounds that act on serotonin receptors, causing hallucinogenic effects.
  - Historically used in indigenous rituals and ceremonies, especially in Mesoamerica.

- **Modern significance:**
  - Subject of growing scientific research for potential therapeutic applications (e.g., depression, PTSD, anxiety treatment).
  - Psilocybin mushrooms have complex legal status: decriminalized or legalized for medical research in some countries, strictly prohibited in others.

- **Ecological role:**
  - Important decomposers, particularly in nutrient-rich or disturbed soils.

- **Caution:**
  - Some _Psilocybe_ species are easily confused with deadly species from _Galerina_ or _Pholiotina_ — expert identification is critical.

The genus _Psilocybe_ symbolizes the intersection of mycology, medicine, psychology, spirituality, and modern culture.
