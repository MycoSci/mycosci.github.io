## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Amanita muscaria_ (for the type genus _Amanita_)  
* **Authority & year:** E.-J. Gilbert, 1940  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Free gills, white spore prints, universal veil remnants (volvas and warts), mycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Amanitaceae** was described by **Émile-Jacques Gilbert** in 1940. Its name derives from the type genus _Amanita_, which includes some of the most iconic mushrooms, both edible and deadly. Early mycologists grouped these fungi based on morphological traits like volvas and ringed stipes, traits that modern molecular studies have confirmed as hallmarks of a cohesive evolutionary lineage.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Amanitaceae** members share highly distinctive and diagnostic features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies with a cap and stipe, usually robust and fleshy.
  - Gills are free from the stipe.
  - Universal veil remnants form structures like warts on the cap and a volva (cup-like base) on the stipe.
  - Partial veil often leaves a persistent annulus (ring) on the stipe.
  - Spore print is white or pale.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, typically inamyloid (not staining blue-black in iodine), although exceptions exist.
  - Volva tissue is distinctive in structure, aiding in species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include free gills, volval structures, and white spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) confirm **Amanitaceae** as a robust, monophyletic family within Agaricales.

Major genera include:

- _Amanita_ (largest genus, containing deadly, edible, and hallucinogenic species)
- _Limacella_ (slimy-capped relatives)
- _Catatrama_, _Saproamanita_, and others (less well-known or newly recognized)

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

      ├── Catatrama
      └── Saproamanita
```
The diversification of Amanitaceae is linked to the expansion of angiosperm and coniferous forests during the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic periods.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests (temperate, tropical, boreal), woodlands, savannas.
- **Substrates:** Soil; occasionally on forest litter.
- **Trophic modes:** Obligate ectomycorrhizal symbionts with trees and shrubs.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; abundant worldwide, especially in forested ecosystems.

Amanitaceae species play critical roles in nutrient exchange and forest health through their mycorrhizal associations.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Amanitaceae** fungi have a profound impact on human history, ecology, and culture:

- **Toxic and deadly species:**
  - _Amanita phalloides_ (death cap) and _Amanita virosa_ (destroying angel) cause most fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide due to amatoxins.
  - Symptoms of poisoning include delayed onset of gastrointestinal distress followed by potentially fatal liver and kidney failure.

- **Edible species:**
  - _Amanita caesarea_ (Caesar's mushroom) and related species are prized edibles in Europe and parts of Asia.

- **Psychoactive species:**
  - _Amanita muscaria_ (fly agaric) is famous for its psychoactive compounds (muscimol and ibotenic acid) and historical use in shamanic traditions.

- **Cultural significance:**
  - _Amanita muscaria_ is iconic in global folklore, fairy tales, and modern pop culture, symbolizing "the mushroom" visually.

- **Conservation concerns:**
  - Some Amanita species are rare and sensitive to habitat loss and climate change, reflecting broader forest ecosystem health.

The family Amanitaceae encompasses some of the most dangerous, beautiful, and culturally significant fungi in the world.
