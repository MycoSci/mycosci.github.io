# Physalacriaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Physalacriaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Physalacria inflata_ (for the type genus _Physalacria_)  
* **Authority & year:** Corner, 1970  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized mushrooms, often tough or gelatinous textures, white spore prints, wood-associated saprotrophs and pathogens  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Physalacriaceae** was formally proposed by **E. J. H. Corner** in 1970. The name is based on the type genus _Physalacria_, referring to "bladder-like" swellings (_physa_ = "bladder" and _acria_ = "pointed tip") seen in some fruitbody structures. Modern molecular studies expanded the family to include genera traditionally separated by morphology but united by DNA phylogenies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Physalacriaceae** fungi are variable in form but share certain key traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies range from classic gilled mushrooms to odd, stalked, and club-like forms.
  - Caps (where present) are dry to slightly sticky, often whitish, tan, brown, or orange.
  - Gills are usually attached (adnate to adnexed) and pale.
  - Stipes can be tough, wiry, gelatinous, or club-shaped.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and mostly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include white spores, saprotrophic or parasitic lifestyles, and adaptation to wood or herbaceous material.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Physalacriaceae** within Agaricales, separating it from Marasmiaceae and Mycenaceae despite earlier superficial similarities.

Major genera include:

- _Armillaria_ (honey mushrooms)
- _Flammulina_ (velvet shanks)
- _Physalacria_ (odd stalked fungi)
- _Oudemansiella_
- _Xerula_

The family likely diversified as saprotrophic and parasitic fungi alongside the development of forest ecosystems during the Cenozoic.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests, woodlands, mossy areas, dead logs, roots, and sometimes buried wood.
- **Substrates:** Living and dead wood, leaf litter, soil, herbaceous stems.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic and parasitic; some species (e.g., _Armillaria_) are serious tree pathogens.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found widely from boreal forests to tropical rainforests.

Many species fruit during wet seasons, often in dense troops or large clusters.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Physalacriaceae** fungi are important economically, ecologically, and culturally:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Flammulina velutipes_ (enoki mushroom) is widely cultivated and highly valued in cuisine.
  - _Armillaria mellea_ (honey mushroom) is edible after cooking, but correct identification is essential.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - _Armillaria_ species are notorious for causing root rot and significant tree mortality in forests and orchards.
  - Many species are key decomposers of lignified plant material.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Enoki mushrooms (_Flammulina_) are a staple in East Asian cuisine.
  - _Armillaria_ species’ glowing mycelium ("foxfire") has inspired folklore and scientific curiosity.

Their economic importance, pathogenic potential, and fascinating biological traits make Physalacriaceae one of the most notable families in Agaricales.
