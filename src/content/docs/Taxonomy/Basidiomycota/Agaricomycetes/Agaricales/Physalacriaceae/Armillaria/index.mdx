## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Armillaria mellea_  
* **Authority & year:** (Vahl) P. Kumm., 1871  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium to large honey-colored mushrooms, tough rhizomorphs, wood-decaying pathogens, white spore prints  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Armillaria** was formally described by **Paul Kummer** in 1871, based on earlier work by **Martin Vahl**. The name comes from Latin _armilla_ ("bracelet" or "ring"), referring to the partial veil remnants that often form a ring (annulus) around the stipe.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Armillaria** species are robust forest mushrooms easily recognized by a combination of traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, often sticky when moist, usually yellow-brown to honey-colored with fine scales.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to slightly decurrent), initially pale, becoming slightly pinkish with age.
  - Stipes are tough, fibrous, often featuring a persistent, membranous ring.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to broadly oval.
  - Clamp connections are common.

**Synapomorphies** include the production of black rhizomorphs (cords of fungal tissue) and parasitic growth on living trees.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Armillaria** within Physalacriaceae, distinct from other gilled wood-decay fungi like _Pleurotus_.

_Armillaria_ species diversified alongside forest ecosystems, evolving strategies as both saprotrophs and aggressive pathogens.

Important species include:

- _Armillaria mellea_ (honey mushroom)
- _Armillaria gallica_ (bulbous honey fungus)
- _Armillaria ostoyae_ (among the largest living organisms on Earth)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests, woodlands, orchards, gardens; associated with dead or living trees and woody plants.
- **Substrates:** Dead wood, live tree roots, decaying stumps, and woody debris.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic and pathogenic; causes root rot and tree death.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in temperate and subtropical regions worldwide.

Species often fruit in dense clusters at the base of infected trees, often after the first autumn rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Armillaria** fungi have huge ecological and economic significance:

- **Pathogenicity:**
  - _Armillaria_ species are serious pathogens, causing **Armillaria root rot**, leading to widespread tree mortality in natural forests, orchards, and vineyards.
  - Black rhizomorphs allow the fungus to spread underground from tree to tree.

- **Record-holding organisms:**
  - _Armillaria ostoyae_ in Oregon's Malheur National Forest forms one of the largest and oldest living organisms on Earth, estimated to be over 2,400 years old and covering several square miles.

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_Armillaria mellea_) are considered edible after thorough cooking to neutralize mild toxins.
  - Proper identification is critical, as raw consumption can cause gastric distress.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important recyclers of dead wood and contributors to forest floor structure.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Their dramatic fruiting displays and parasitic impact have made _Armillaria_ prominent in both folklore and forestry science.

Their dual role as destructive pathogens and important saprotrophs makes _Armillaria_ one of the most ecologically impactful fungal genera.
