## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Flammulina velutipes_  
* **Authority & year:** (Curtis) Singer, 1951  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized mushrooms, sticky to slimy caps, velvety dark stems, white spore prints, winter-fruiting wood decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Flammulina** was formally redefined by **Rolf Singer** in 1951 based on earlier names proposed by **William Curtis**. The name _Flammulina_ means "little flame" in Latin, referencing the orange to golden coloration of many species, evoking the appearance of small flames on logs in cold seasons.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Flammulina** species are notable for their cold-tolerant growth and sticky caps:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly flattened, sticky to slimy when moist, colored orange to yellowish-brown.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to slightly decurrent), white to pale cream.
  - Stipes are centrally attached, tough, often dark brown to black at the base, and velvety or hairy.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are present at hyphal septa.

**Synapomorphies** include sticky caps, velvety stems, cold-season fruiting, and white spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Flammulina** within Physalacriaceae, closely related to _Armillaria_, _Oudemansiella_, and _Xerula_.

_Flammulina_ diversified alongside forest ecosystems, specializing in wood decomposition in cold, temperate climates.

Important species include:

- _Flammulina velutipes_ (velvet shank or enoki)
- _Flammulina fennae_
- _Flammulina populicola_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead hardwoods, stumps, fallen logs, forest edges, gardens.
- **Substrates:** Dead or dying wood, particularly of broadleaf trees like elm, willow, and poplar.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, specializing in the decomposition of lignified plant material.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in temperate regions across North America, Europe, Asia, Australasia, and elsewhere.

Species fruit mainly during late autumn, winter, and early spring, enduring frosts and mild freezing.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Flammulina** fungi are among the most economically important and culturally celebrated mushrooms:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Flammulina velutipes_ ("enoki" or "enokitake") is cultivated extensively worldwide, particularly in East Asia, prized for its crisp texture and mild, slightly sweet flavor.
  - Cultivated forms are grown in the dark to produce long, thin, white fruitbodies, distinct from the wild form.

- **Medicinal potential:**
  - Contains polysaccharides and compounds under investigation for antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical for recycling wood in forests, especially during colder seasons when fewer fungi are active.

- **Cultural significance:**
  - Enoki mushrooms are a culinary staple in East Asian cuisines (soups, hot pots, salads) and increasingly popular worldwide.

Their resilience, culinary value, and ecological role make _Flammulina_ one of the most prominent genera among cold-weather mushrooms.
