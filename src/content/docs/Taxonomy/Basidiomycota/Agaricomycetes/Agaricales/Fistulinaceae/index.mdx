# Fistulinaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Fistulinaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Fistulina hepatica_ (for the type genus _Fistulina_)  
* **Authority & year:** Lotsy, 1907  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Beefsteak-like fruiting bodies, poroid hymenophore, fleshy texture, reddish juice exuding from cuts  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Fistulinaceae** was established by **Johannes Paulus Lotsy** in 1907 to accommodate the type genus _Fistulina_. The name _Fistulina_ derives from Latin _fistula_ ("pipe" or "tube"), alluding to the microscopic tube-like structures of the spore-bearing surface. Although historically placed near polypores, molecular phylogenetics now situates Fistulinaceae closer to Agaricales.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Fistulinaceae** fungi, though limited in number of species, are striking in appearance:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) are bracket- to tongue-shaped, thick and fleshy, resembling cuts of raw meat (_Fistulina hepatica_ especially).
  - Hymenophore is poroid (tube-bearing) but with tubes that are discrete and not fused.
  - Flesh exudes reddish juice when fresh and cut.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, bearing four basidiospores.
  - Spores are smooth, ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid, hyaline.
  - Tube walls are composed of relatively simple hyphae, unlike many true polypores.

**Synapomorphies** include a fleshy bracket morphology, discrete pores, and reddish exudation upon injury.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Fistulinaceae** as an early-diverging lineage within the Agaricales, distinct from both true polypores (Polyporales) and the fleshy gilled mushrooms.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricales
 ├── Agaricaceae
 ├── Cortinariaceae
 ├── Fistulinaceae
 └── Others
```
_Fistulina hepatica_ and relatives likely represent an ancient adaptive lineage evolving poroid structures independently of other polypore fungi.

Known genera:

- _Fistulina_ (primary and largest genus)
- Some molecular analyses suggest a few allied taxa may eventually be placed within Fistulinaceae as well.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Deciduous forests, especially in association with oak, chestnut, and eucalyptus.
- **Substrates:** Living and dead hardwoods, occasionally causing brown rot.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic and weakly parasitic; capable of slowly decaying living trees.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan but most common in temperate and subtropical zones.

_Fistulina hepatica_ is a classic sight in old oak woods and mature chestnut forests.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Fistulinaceae** fungi have minor but notable cultural and ecological importance:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Fistulina hepatica_ ("beefsteak fungus") is edible when young, with a sour, tangy flavor.
  - Often used in vegetarian dishes as a meat substitute for its texture and appearance.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers and recyclers of hardwood.
  - Their slow decay can create important habitat niches for insects, birds, and other fungi.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - _Fistulina hepatica_ has been featured in culinary traditions in parts of Europe.
  - The "bleeding" effect when sliced has fascinated foragers and naturalists alike.

Although comprising few species, the family _Fistulinaceae_ is instantly recognizable and ecologically distinct among wood-inhabiting fungi.
