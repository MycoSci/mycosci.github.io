# Lycoperdaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Lycoperdaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lycoperdon perlatum_ (for the type genus _Lycoperdon_)  
* **Authority & year:** Chevallier, 1826  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Puffballs, globose to pear-shaped fruiting bodies, internal spore mass (gleba), spore release through a pore  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Lycoperdaceae** was described by **François Fulgis Chevallier** in 1826, based around the puffball-forming fungi. The name comes from Greek _lycos_ ("wolf") and _perdo_ ("to break wind"), humorously describing the sudden puff of spores expelled when mature puffballs are compressed.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lycoperdaceae** fungi are easily recognized by their puffball habit:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are globose, subglobose, or pear-shaped, often stalkless or with a short stipe.
  - Outer surface (exoperidium) may be smooth, warty, spiny, or cracked.
  - Mature fruitbodies develop an apical pore for spore dispersal.
  - Young gleba is firm and white; mature gleba becomes olive-brown and powdery.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are brown, globose to subglobose, finely ornamented or smooth.
  - Capillitia (sterile supportive threads) are often present inside the gleba, aiding in spore dispersal.

**Synapomorphies** include puffball morphology, internal spore development, and pore-based spore release.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) support **Lycoperdaceae** as a distinct family within Agaricales, although closely allied to gilled families like _Agaricaceae_.

Major genera include:

- _Lycoperdon_ (classic small puffballs)
- _Bovista_ (larger puffballs with detached gleba)
- _Calvatia_ (giant puffballs)
- _Morganella_ (smaller puffballs with thick walls)

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

Agaricales
 ├── Agaricaceae
 ├── Cortinariaceae
 ├── Lycoperdaceae
      ├── Lycoperdon
      ├── Bovista
      ├── Calvatia
      └── Morganella
```
The Lycoperdaceae likely evolved from gilled ancestors via reduction and specialization for dry, aerial spore dispersal.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, forest floors, meadows, disturbed soils, sand dunes, lawns.
- **Substrates:** Soil, decaying wood, moss, occasionally dung.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic material and recycling nutrients.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widely distributed from tropical to arctic regions.

Puffballs often appear after rains and rapidly mature in warm, humid conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lycoperdaceae** fungi are culturally significant and ecologically important:

- **Edibility:**
  - Many species (especially _Calvatia gigantea_ and young _Lycoperdon_ species) are edible when young and the gleba is pure white.
  - Care is required to avoid confusing young puffballs with immature toxic Amanitas.

- **Traditional uses:**
  - Puffballs have been used historically to staunch bleeding wounds (spore dust as a coagulant).
  - Puffball spores have also featured in folklore and magical traditions.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers in grassland and forest ecosystems.
  - Contribute to soil structure and nutrient cycling.

Their charming forms, ecological role, and culinary potential (when properly identified) make Lycoperdaceae an iconic fungal family.
