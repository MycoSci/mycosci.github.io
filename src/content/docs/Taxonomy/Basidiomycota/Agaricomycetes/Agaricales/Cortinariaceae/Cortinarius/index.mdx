## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Cortinarius violaceus_  
* **Authority & year:** (Scopoli) Gray, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Large gilled mushrooms, cortina (cobweb-like veil), rusty-brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Cortinarius** was named by **Samuel Frederick Gray** in 1821, based on the earlier work of **Giovanni Antonio Scopoli**. The name comes from the Latin _cortina_ ("curtain") referring to the characteristic cobwebby veil (cortina) covering the gills of young mushrooms. Historically a vast genus, molecular phylogenetics has since refined its limits, but _Cortinarius_ remains one of the largest and most iconic fungal genera.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Cortinarius** species are known for their often large, colorful, and structurally complex fruiting bodies:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps (pilei) range from convex to broadly umbonate, often with vivid colors—purple, blue, yellow, brown, orange, or red.
  - Gills (lamellae) are attached to the stipe and often change color as spores mature, becoming rusty-brown.
  - Stipes (stems) are often stout, and remnants of the cortina may leave fibrillose zones or faint rings.
  - Spore print is rusty-brown to cinnamon-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, bearing four spores.
  - Spores are usually ornamented (warted or roughened) and dextrinoid (reddish-brown reaction in Melzer’s reagent).
  - Cheilocystidia (on gill edges) and pileocystidia (on cap surface) are diagnostic features for species-level identification.

**Synapomorphies** include rusty-brown spore prints, presence of a cortina, and ornamented spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Recent molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2, TEF1) have divided _Cortinarius_ sensu lato into multiple genera, but **Cortinarius** sensu stricto remains the core group retaining many of the classic species.

_Cortinarius_ diversified alongside the radiation of ectomycorrhizal tree hosts during the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic periods.

Important clades or groups within _Cortinarius_ include:

- _Telamonia_ (dry, dull-colored species)
- _Dermocybe_ (brightly colored, pigment-rich species)
- _Myxacium_ (viscid or slimy-capped species)
- _Phlegmacium_ (stout, dry or viscid species — now often treated as a separate genus)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Primarily in forests (temperate, boreal, tropical montane), especially under ectomycorrhizal trees such as birch, oak, beech, spruce, and pine.
- **Substrates:** Soil in symbiotic association with tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Obligate ectomycorrhizal symbionts.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; abundant in the temperate zones of Europe, North America, Asia, Australia, and parts of South America.

Many species fruit prolifically in autumn after seasonal rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Cortinarius** fungi are ecologically vital but pose challenges for foragers and researchers:

- **Edibility and toxicity:**
  - Some species are edible (e.g., _Cortinarius caperatus_, the gypsy mushroom).
  - Many others are dangerously toxic — especially _Cortinarius orellanus_ and _Cortinarius rubellus_, containing orellanine, which causes delayed-onset, potentially fatal kidney failure.
  - Due to identification difficulty and toxicity risk, most foragers avoid _Cortinarius_ species entirely.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Crucial symbiotic partners for forest trees, enhancing nutrient uptake and forest health.
  - Involved in nitrogen and carbon cycling through mycorrhizal networks.

- **Cultural significance:**
  - Some species are used in natural dyeing, producing brilliant yellows, oranges, and reds.
  - Their vivid diversity and ecological associations make them important in mycological research and fungal conservation efforts.

Cortinarius represents both the beauty and the dangers of fungal biodiversity, requiring deep expertise for safe handling and study.
