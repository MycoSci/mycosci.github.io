**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Cortinariaceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Cortinarius violaceus_ (for the type genus _Cortinarius_)  
* **Authority & year:** Roussel, 1806  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gilled mushrooms with cobweb-like veils (cortinas), rusty-brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Cortinariaceae** was formally described by **Henri François Anne de Roussel** in 1806. It is named after the type genus _Cortinarius_, referencing the distinctive cortina (a delicate cobweb-like veil) that stretches between the cap and stipe in young mushrooms. Long recognized for its large and colorful mushrooms, Cortinariaceae has been dramatically reshaped by modern molecular phylogenetics.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Cortinariaceae** fungi are diverse, but share key traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Basidiocarps are typically medium to large mushrooms with fleshy caps and stems.
  - A cortina (cobwebby partial veil) is often present in young stages, though it may disappear with maturity.
  - Gills (lamellae) are attached, often crowded, and change color as spores mature.
  - Spore prints are rusty-brown to reddish-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, usually four-spored.
  - Spores are ornamented (warted or roughened), brown, and often dextrinoid (staining reddish-brown in Melzer’s reagent).
  - Cystidia are common and variable, important for species-level identification.

**Synapomorphies** include rusty-brown spore prints, ornamented spores, and the presence of a cortina.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2, TEF1) have revealed that the traditional, huge concept of **Cortinariaceae** was polyphyletic. As a result:

- _Cortinarius_ sensu lato has been split into multiple genera (_Cortinarius_, _Phlegmacium_, _Thaxterogaster_, _Calonarius_, etc.).
- **Cortinariaceae** now includes these genera in a refined, monophyletic sense.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

      ├── Cortinarius
      ├── Phlegmacium
      ├── Thaxterogaster
      ├── Calonarius
      └── Others
```
The family likely diversified alongside ectomycorrhizal plant lineages (especially Fagaceae, Pinaceae, and Betulaceae) during the Cretaceous and early Paleogene.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests (temperate, boreal, tropical montane), especially rich in ectomycorrhizal trees.
- **Substrates:** Soil in association with living tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, forming mutualistic nutrient exchanges with host plants.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; most diverse in temperate and boreal forests, but present in tropical montane ecosystems as well.

Some Cortinariaceae fungi fruit abundantly after rains in late summer and autumn.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Cortinariaceae** fungi are critical ecologically but require caution culturally:

- **Edibility and toxicity:**
  - Very few species are safely edible; some (e.g., _Cortinarius caperatus_, the gypsy mushroom) are choice edibles.
  - Many species contain dangerous toxins — notably _Cortinarius orellanus_ and _Cortinarius rubellus_, which produce orellanine, a nephrotoxic compound causing delayed kidney failure.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Vital symbiotic partners for many forest trees.
  - Enhance soil structure, nutrient cycling, and forest resilience.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Their vivid colors (purples, oranges, reds) and large size have fascinated naturalists and mushroom enthusiasts for centuries.

Due to the serious risks of misidentification and delayed toxicity, foraging Cortinariaceae is generally discouraged without expert knowledge.
