# Sarcomyxaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Sarcomyxaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sarcomyxa serotina_ (for the type genus _Sarcomyxa_)  
* **Authority & year:** Zmitr., 2006  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized, wood-inhabiting mushrooms, often olive-green to brownish caps, decurrent gills, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Sarcomyxaceae** was formally erected by **Alexey Zmitrovich** in 2006 after molecular phylogenetic studies revealed that _Sarcomyxa_ species formed a distinct lineage, separate from other traditional oyster-like fungi. The name derives from Greek _sarco-_ ("flesh") and _myxa_ ("mucus" or "slime"), hinting at the somewhat gelatinous or soft texture of these fungi.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sarcomyxaceae** members are visually distinctive yet often overlooked:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are semicircular, oyster-shaped, or fan-like, often with a greasy to sticky surface when moist.
  - Colors range from olive-green, brownish, to yellowish or orange hues.
  - Gills are decurrent (running down the stipe or point of attachment), crowded, and pale to yellowish.
  - Stipes are absent or rudimentary and lateral.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are present at hyphal septa.

**Synapomorphies** include fleshy fruitbodies, sticky caps, decurrent gills, white spores, and wood-inhabiting habits.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Sarcomyxaceae** as a distinct family within Agaricales, clearly separated from _Pleurotaceae_ and _Omphalotaceae_ despite superficial similarities.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricales
 ├── Pleurotaceae
 ├── Omphalotaceae
 └── Sarcomyxaceae
      └── Sarcomyxa
```
The genus likely evolved in temperate forest ecosystems, specializing in decomposition of decaying hardwood.

Key genus:

- _Sarcomyxa_ (currently the only genus recognized in the family)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Decaying logs, stumps, and fallen branches, mostly in hardwood forests.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead or dying wood, occasionally on still-living trees in decline.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing woody material.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species fruit mainly in cooler seasons (late summer through autumn), often after heavy rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sarcomyxaceae** fungi, though small in number, have growing importance:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Sarcomyxa serotina_ ("late fall oyster") is sometimes considered edible after thorough cooking, but opinions vary regionally.
  - Wild collections should be done carefully, as aging specimens become tough and less palatable.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers in forest ecosystems, helping break down tough lignocellulosic materials.
  - Contribute to the recycling of nutrients into the forest soil.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Their distinction from _Pleurotus_ reshaped the understanding of oyster-like mushroom evolution and diversity.

Their understated beauty, critical ecological role, and connection to late-season fungal activity make _Sarcomyxaceae_ an important family among wood decay fungi.
