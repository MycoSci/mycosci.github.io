## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Pseudosperma rimosum_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) Matheny & Esteve-Raventós, 2019  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized mushrooms, brown to ochre colors, smooth spores, absence of thick-walled pleurocystidia, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Pseudosperma** was formally erected by **Brandon Matheny** and **Fernando Esteve-Raventós** in 2019 after molecular phylogenetic studies revealed that several traditional _Inocybe_ species formed a distinct clade. The name means "false seed" (_pseudo-_ + _sperma_), hinting at subtle but critical differences in spore and cystidia characteristics compared to _Inocybe_ sensu stricto.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Pseudosperma** species are outwardly similar to small _Inocybe_ species but differ microscopically:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are dry, often cracked (rimose) or scaly, conical to broadly convex.
  - Colors are usually earthy—ochre, tan, brown, or yellowish.
  - Gills are adnexed to adnate, becoming rusty brown with spore maturity.
  - Stipes are slender to moderately robust, often without a noticeable bulb.
  - Spore prints are brown to ochre-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth (unlike many warted _Inocybe_ spores) and ellipsoid to almond-shaped.
  - Pleurocystidia are thin-walled or absent, a key difference from true _Inocybe_.

**Synapomorphies** include smooth spores, absence or rarity of thick-walled pleurocystidia, and ectomycorrhizal lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) position **Pseudosperma** as a distinct, well-supported clade within Inocybaceae, separate from _Inocybe_ and _Inosperma_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Inocybaceae
 ├── Inocybe
 ├── Inosperma
 ├── Pseudosperma
 └── Auritella
```
The genus likely diversified with ectomycorrhizal trees during the mid-to-late Cenozoic, adapting to diverse soil and climatic conditions.

Important species include:

- _Pseudosperma rimosum_ (formerly _Inocybe rimosa_)
- _Pseudosperma aureocitrinum_
- _Pseudosperma ochraceum_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests (temperate and boreal), woodland edges, heathlands, and disturbed soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in organic matter, moss beds, leaf litter, often associated with specific tree species.
- **Trophic modes:** Obligate ectomycorrhizal, forming mutualistic relationships with hardwoods and conifers.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found across Europe, North America, Asia, Australasia, and parts of South America.

Species are often among the first ectomycorrhizal fungi to appear in secondary forests and young woodlands.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Pseudosperma** fungi are important ecologically but pose risks for foragers:

- **Toxicity:**
  - Many species contain **muscarine**, causing sweating, salivation, and gastrointestinal distress; potentially life-threatening if untreated.
  - _Pseudosperma rimosum_ is particularly known for muscarinic poisoning incidents.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Contribute to tree health by enhancing nutrient and water uptake via ectomycorrhizal networks.
  - Play a role in forest succession and soil ecosystem development.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Some species are associated with ancient woodland or specialized forest types and may serve as bioindicators for conservation assessment.

Their cryptic beauty, ecological importance, and toxic potential make _Pseudosperma_ a genus deserving of careful study and respect.
