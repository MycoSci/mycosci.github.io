# Inocybaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Inocybaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Inocybe geophylla_ (for the type genus _Inocybe_)  
* **Authority & year:** Jülich, 1981  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized mushrooms, fibrous to scaly caps, brown to ochre spore prints, strong odors, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Inocybaceae** was formally established by **Walter Jülich** in 1981 to clarify the phylogenetic placement of small, brown, and often fibrous mushrooms previously lumped into broader categories like Cortinariaceae. The name derives from the type genus _Inocybe_, meaning "fibrous head" in Greek, referring to the often fibrillose cap surfaces.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Inocybaceae** fungi are challenging yet rewarding to identify:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are typically conical to bell-shaped, often fibrillose (fibrous) or scaly.
  - Colors range from whitish, tan, ochre, brown, to grayish hues.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to adnexed) and brownish with maturity.
  - Stipes are slender, often with bulbous bases; no universal veil but sometimes a cortina-like partial veil.
  - Spore prints are brown to ochre-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth to angular, often ornamented, and brown in color.
  - Pleurocystidia are usually thick-walled, sometimes with distinctive shapes (e.g., fusiform, encrusted), critical for species ID.

**Synapomorphies** include fibrous caps, brown spore prints, and well-developed cystidia.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Inocybaceae** as a well-supported, monophyletic group within Agaricales, distinct from Cortinariaceae and other brown-spored families.

Major genera include:

- _Inocybe_ (core genus)
- _Pseudosperma_ (segregated based on molecular studies)
- _Inosperma_ (another segregate)
- _Auritella_ (mostly tropical species)

The family likely diversified during the Cenozoic alongside ectomycorrhizal trees such as oaks, beeches, birches, and pines.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests (temperate and tropical), woodland edges, grasslands, mossy banks, and heathlands.
- **Substrates:** Soil, moss, and leaf litter, usually near living tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Obligate ectomycorrhizal symbionts with a wide range of trees and shrubs.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; very common in northern temperate regions but also diverse in tropical and montane habitats.

Inocybes are particularly abundant in disturbed soils, nutrient-poor areas, and early successional ecosystems.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Inocybaceae** fungi are ecologically crucial but hazardous to foragers:

- **Toxicity:**
  - Many _Inocybe_ species contain muscarine, a potent toxin causing symptoms such as sweating, salivation, and severe gastrointestinal distress.
  - Poisoning incidents are frequent where small brown mushrooms are collected without expert knowledge.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical for tree health and nutrient acquisition through mycorrhizal relationships.
  - Important for early colonization of poor soils and restoration of degraded forests.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Some species are rare or habitat-specific and serve as indicators of ecosystem health, particularly in old-growth forests and ancient woodlands.

Despite their toxicity, Inocybaceae species are fascinating components of fungal biodiversity and forest ecology.
