## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Inocybe geophylla_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) Fries, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized mushrooms, fibrous or scaly caps, brown spore prints, often muscarinic toxins, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Inocybe** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1821. The name derives from Greek _inos_ ("fibrous") and _cybe_ ("head"), describing the characteristic fibrous or scaly appearance of the cap surface. _Inocybe_ is one of the largest and most taxonomically complex genera of small brown mushrooms (LBMs).

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Inocybe** species share a distinct set of morphological traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are often conical, bell-shaped, or umbonate (with a central bump), covered in fibrils or small scales.
  - Colors range from whitish, grayish, ochre, brown, to purplish hues.
  - Gills are adnexed to adnate, becoming brownish as spores mature.
  - Stipes are slender, often with a slightly bulbous base, lacking a true ring.
  - Spore prints are brown to ochre-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth to angular or nodulose, thick-walled, brown.
  - Pleurocystidia are usually thick-walled, often with crystalline encrustations.

**Synapomorphies** include a fibrous or scaly cap texture, brown spore prints, and distinctive cystidia.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) confirm **Inocybe** as a major lineage within Hymenogastraceae. Ongoing molecular revisions have split former species into related genera like _Inosperma_ and _Pseudosperma_, but _Inocybe_ sensu stricto remains large.

_Inocybe_ species diversified alongside ectomycorrhizal trees in boreal, temperate, and tropical ecosystems.

Important species include:

- _Inocybe geophylla_ (type species)
- _Inocybe rimosa_
- _Inocybe patouillardii_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests (boreal, temperate, tropical), grasslands, woodland edges, heathlands.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in organic matter, often associated with mossy or leaf-littered ground.
- **Trophic modes:** Obligate ectomycorrhizal symbionts with trees (oaks, pines, birches, beeches, eucalypts).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; especially diverse and abundant in temperate forests.

Species are often among the earliest colonizers of nutrient-poor or disturbed soils.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Inocybe** fungi are ecologically vital but present significant risks for human health:

- **Toxicity:**
  - Many species contain **muscarine**, a potent neurotoxin causing excessive salivation, sweating, vomiting, and potentially death.
  - _Inocybe_ is one of the most dangerous genera of LBMs ("little brown mushrooms") due to its toxic potential and confusing morphology.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical partners for nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.
  - Help trees access water and mineral nutrients, enhancing forest resilience.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Some species are indicators of ancient woodland or undisturbed ecosystems.
  - Others are rare or narrowly endemic and may be of conservation concern.

Due to the combination of ecological importance and human health risks, _Inocybe_ species demand respect and careful study in the field.
