# Laccaria <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Hydnangiaceae › **Genus:** Laccaria

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Laccaria laccata_  
* **Authority & year:** (Scopoli) Cooke, 1884  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium gilled mushrooms, thick widely spaced gills, often brightly colored, white spore prints, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Laccaria** was described by **Mordecai Cubitt Cooke** in 1884, building on earlier descriptions by **Giovanni Antonio Scopoli**. The name is derived from the Latin _lacca_ ("lacquer" or "varnish"), likely referencing the often shiny or vivid colors of these fungi. Molecular studies have confirmed _Laccaria_ as a distinct lineage within Hydnangiaceae, critical to forest ecosystem functioning.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Laccaria** species are distinctive among forest fungi for their robust structure and bright colors:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flattened, often rough or scaly, sometimes smooth.
  - Gills are thick, widely spaced, often pale but developing pinkish hues.
  - Stipes are fibrous, sometimes covered in fibrils or scaly textures.
  - Color varies from purplish, pinkish, reddish-brown, to buff or orange-brown.
  - Spore print is white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are spherical, roughened to spiny (echinulate), and hyaline.
  - Clamp connections are common in the hyphae.

**Synapomorphies** include thick, widely spaced gills, white spore prints, and roughened globose spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) position **Laccaria** firmly within Hydnangiaceae, alongside gasteroid genera like _Hydnangium_.

_Laccaria_ species evolved as ectomycorrhizal partners with a broad range of trees and shrubs during the Cenozoic, adapting to diverse soil and forest types.

Important species include:

- _Laccaria laccata_ ("deceiver")
- _Laccaria amethystina_ ("amethyst deceiver")
- _Laccaria bicolor_ (model ectomycorrhizal species)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, woodlands, heathlands, disturbed soils, and grassy areas.
- **Substrates:** Soil, often among leaf litter or moss, always associated with tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Obligate ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with a wide range of trees and shrubs.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widely distributed across temperate, subtropical, and tropical ecosystems.

_Laccaria_ species are often among the first ectomycorrhizal mushrooms to colonize disturbed or young forests.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Laccaria** fungi have major ecological but modest cultural importance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_Laccaria laccata_, _Laccaria amethystina_) are edible but not highly regarded due to their small size and bland flavor.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Vital partners for forest trees, enhancing nutrient uptake, drought resistance, and soil structure.
  - _Laccaria bicolor_ is a key model organism in symbiosis research, with a fully sequenced genome revealing mechanisms of mycorrhizal interaction.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - _Laccaria_ presence is often a good indicator of healthy forest ecosystems.

Their bright colors, ecological roles, and widespread occurrence make _Laccaria_ an important and often visible part of forest mycoflora.
