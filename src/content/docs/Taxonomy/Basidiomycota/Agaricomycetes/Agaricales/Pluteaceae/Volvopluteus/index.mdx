## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Volvopluteus gloiocephalus_  
* **Authority & year:** (DC.) Vizzini, 2011  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Large mushrooms with free gills, pink spore prints, prominent volva, slimy caps, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Volvopluteus** was erected by **Alfredo Vizzini** in 2011 to separate certain volva-bearing species from _Volvariella_ based on molecular evidence. The name combines _volva_ ("wrapper") and _Pluteus_ ("shield"), reflecting the genus' characteristics: free gills, pink spores, and a volva, but genetically distinct from _Volvariella_.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Volvopluteus** species share a characteristic combination of features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are large, convex to flat, slimy when moist, often white, gray, or brownish.
  - Gills are free from the stipe, starting white and becoming pinkish with spore maturity.
  - Stipes are stout, white to grayish, with a prominent volva at the base.
  - Spore prints are pink to pinkish-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, ellipsoid, hyaline to pinkish in deposit.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include free gills, slimy caps, pink spore prints, a prominent volva, and absence of clamps.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Volvopluteus** as a separate lineage within Pluteaceae, distinct from _Volvariella_ and _Pluteus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Pluteaceae
 ├── Pluteus
 ├── Volvariella
 └── Volvopluteus
```
_Volvopluteus_ likely evolved to specialize in nutrient-rich soils and disturbed habitats, thriving on organic debris.

Key species:

- _Volvopluteus gloiocephalus_ (formerly known as _Volvariella gloiocephala_ or _Volvariella speciosa_)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, gardens, agricultural fields, compost heaps, disturbed soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in organic matter; sometimes decaying herbaceous plant debris.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down dead plant material.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widely distributed across Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Australasia.

Species often fruit in nutrient-enriched soils, especially after heavy rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Volvopluteus** fungi have modest economic importance but are ecologically valuable:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Volvopluteus gloiocephalus_ is considered edible when young and firm, although not widely sought after due to bland taste and slimy texture.
  - As with all volva-bearing mushrooms, caution is required to avoid confusing them with poisonous _Amanita_ species.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important decomposers of organic debris in disturbed habitats, gardens, and agricultural settings.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Featured occasionally in field guides, primarily as a cautionary example for foragers to differentiate from deadly amanitas.

Their large size, slimy appearance, and broad ecological adaptability make _Volvopluteus_ an interesting group among pink-spored mushrooms.
