## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Pluteus cervinus_ (for the type genus _Pluteus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Kotlaba & Pouzar, 1972  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Mushrooms with free gills, pink spore prints, saprotrophic on wood or organic debris  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Pluteaceae** was established by **František Kotlaba** and **Zdeněk Pouzar** in 1972 to formally accommodate fungi characterized by free gills and pink spore prints. The name is based on _Pluteus_, meaning "shield" in Latin, alluding to the broad cap shapes common among its members.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Pluteaceae** fungi are defined by several distinctive features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat or slightly depressed, often brightly colored, scaly, or smooth.
  - Gills are free from the stipe and pinkish at maturity due to spore coloration.
  - Stipes are central, slender to robust, and without a ring.
  - Spore prints are pink to salmon-colored.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline to slightly pinkish in deposit, ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Cheilocystidia are often prominent and diagnostic in species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include free gills, pink spore prints, and saprotrophic lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) confirm **Pluteaceae** as a distinct family within Agaricales, separate from Entolomataceae and Agaricaceae despite also producing pink spores.

Major genera within Pluteaceae include:

- _Pluteus_ (core genus)
- _Volvariella_ (volva-bearing pink-spored mushrooms)

      ├── Pluteus
      └── Volvariella
```
The family likely diversified alongside the proliferation of broadleaf forests during the Cenozoic, specializing in wood decay and litter decomposition.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Fallen logs, stumps, forest litter, compost heaps, rich soils.
- **Substrates:** Primarily decomposing hardwoods, but occasionally herbaceous debris or soil.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing wood and plant debris.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; species found across temperate, subtropical, and tropical zones.

Many species fruit abundantly after rains, especially in late summer to autumn.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Pluteaceae** fungi are modest in culinary and ecological importance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some _Pluteus_ species (e.g., _Pluteus cervinus_) are edible when young, though not highly prized.
  - _Volvariella volvacea_ (the "paddy straw mushroom") is widely cultivated in Asia and highly valued in Asian cuisines.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important decomposers of dead wood and organic debris, aiding forest regeneration and soil formation.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Useful models for studying saprotrophic wood decay and mushroom development.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - _Volvariella_ species are significant in global agriculture as economically important edible mushrooms.

Their combination of pink spore prints, free gills, and wood-inhabiting habits makes Pluteaceae one of the key families among decomposer fungi.
