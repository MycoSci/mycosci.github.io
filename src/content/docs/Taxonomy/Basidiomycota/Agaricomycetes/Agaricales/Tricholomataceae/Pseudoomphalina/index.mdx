## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Pseudoomphalina kalchbrenneri_  
* **Authority & year:** Singer, 1956  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium mushrooms, funnel-shaped or conical caps, decurrent gills, white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Pseudoomphalina** was described by **Rolf Singer** in 1956. The name means "false _Omphalina_," indicating its morphological similarity to _Omphalina_ species but genetic and ecological differences. It is primarily distinguished by its saprotrophic lifestyle (decomposing organic matter) compared to the often lichenized _Omphalina_.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Pseudoomphalina** species share a common set of small, delicate fungal traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to funnel-shaped (infundibuliform) or conical, often smooth and dry.
  - Colors range from pale beige to brown, sometimes grayish.
  - Gills are decurrent, relatively close, and pale-colored.
  - Stipes are slender, central, fibrous, and often colored similarly to the cap.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are present at hyphal septa.

**Synapomorphies** include small size, decurrent gills, pale colorations, white spores, and a saprotrophic lifestyle.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Pseudoomphalina** within Tricholomataceae, though it is a small and morphologically isolated genus compared to its larger relatives like _Tricholoma_ and _Clitocybe_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Tricholomataceae
 ├── Tricholoma
 ├── Clitocybe
 ├── Lepista
 ├── Infundibulicybe
 └── Pseudoomphalina
```
The genus likely evolved in temperate ecosystems to specialize in decomposing soil organic matter, mossy substrates, and fine debris.

Key species include:

- _Pseudoomphalina kalchbrenneri_ (type species)
- _Pseudoomphalina compressipes_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Mossy forest floors, leaf litter, humus-rich soils, shaded woodlands, often moist areas.
- **Substrates:** Decomposing organic material, fine woody debris, and moss beds.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily temperate regions across Europe and North America, though underrecorded due to small size and cryptic appearance.

Species typically fruit after rains in autumn or late summer.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Pseudoomphalina** fungi are small but ecologically meaningful:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not considered edible due to small size, toughness, and lack of culinary value.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Contribute significantly to the decomposition of fine organic matter in forest ecosystems.
  - Play a quiet but crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil health.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Help elucidate relationships between saprotrophic and lichenized lineages among agarics.
  - Serve as reminders of the complexity and hidden diversity of forest fungi.

Their modest appearance belies their importance in maintaining the health of moist temperate forests.
