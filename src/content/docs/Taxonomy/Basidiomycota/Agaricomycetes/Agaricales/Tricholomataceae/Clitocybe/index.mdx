# Clitocybe <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Tricholomataceae › **Genus:** Clitocybe

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Clitocybe nebularis_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) Staude, 1857  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to large mushrooms, decurrent gills, white to pale spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Clitocybe** was described by **Friedrich Staude** in 1857, refining earlier work by **Elias Magnus Fries**. The name comes from Greek _klitos_ ("slope") and _cybe_ ("head"), referring to the sloping shape of the cap and the decurrent (down-running) gills.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Clitocybe** species show a broad variety of forms but share some critical traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to funnel-shaped (infundibuliform), often dry and smooth or slightly fibrous.
  - Colors vary from white, gray, beige, to buff, tan, or orange.
  - Gills are decurrent, closely spaced, and pale (white to cream).
  - Stipes are central, slender to stout, and smooth or slightly fibrous.
  - Spore prints are white to pale cream.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to nearly globose.
  - Clamp connections are common.

**Synapomorphies** include white spore prints, decurrent gills, and funnel-shaped fruitbodies.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) show **Clitocybe** to be polyphyletic — meaning the name historically lumped together several unrelated groups. Some former _Clitocybe_ species are now placed in families like Hygrophoraceae and Tricholomataceae in a stricter sense.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Tricholomataceae
 ├── Tricholoma
 ├── Clitocybe (sensu stricto)
 ├── Lepista (often separated)
 └── Others
```
The true _Clitocybe_ lineage includes many common forest and grassland saprotrophs.

Important species include:

- _Clitocybe nebularis_ (clouded funnel)
- _Clitocybe dealbata_ (ivory funnel, toxic)
- _Clitocybe gibba_ (common funnel)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests (hardwood and coniferous), grassy clearings, woodlands, heathlands, meadows.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in organic matter, leaf litter, moss, dead herbaceous debris.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down leaf litter and woody debris.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in temperate and boreal forests globally.

Species often fruit prolifically after autumn rains, sometimes forming fairy rings.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Clitocybe** fungi are ecologically vital but must be approached with caution:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Clitocybe gibba_) are considered edible when young and fresh.
  - Many others (e.g., _Clitocybe dealbata_, _Clitocybe rivulosa_) are toxic and contain muscarine, a dangerous neurotoxin.
  - Proper identification is crucial before consumption.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Significant decomposers in forests and grasslands, promoting nutrient cycling and soil health.

- **Scientific interest:**
  - Important for studies on fungal ecology, especially the decomposition of lignin-poor organic material.

Their common appearance, vital ecological roles, and potential toxicity make _Clitocybe_ one of the most important and challenging genera for amateur and professional mycologists alike.
