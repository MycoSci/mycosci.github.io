# Tricholomataceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Tricholomataceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Tricholoma terreum_ (for the type genus _Tricholoma_)  
* **Authority & year:** Roze, 1876  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized fleshy mushrooms, white spore prints, attached gills, diverse ecologies  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Tricholomataceae** was first proposed by **Ernest Roze** in 1876, based around the genus _Tricholoma_. Historically, it served as a "wastebasket" for white-spored agarics not fitting easily into other families, but molecular studies have since refined it into a more coherent and natural group.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Tricholomataceae** fungi are highly variable but unified by some key characteristics:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flattened, dry to viscid depending on species.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to adnexed) or notched (sinuate), usually white or pale.
  - Stipes are central and fleshy, often firm and stout.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include white spore prints, attached gills, and relatively fleshy fruitbodies, although species' ecology and macromorphology vary widely.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) dramatically reshaped the family: many genera once lumped here have been moved into new families (e.g., Lyophyllaceae, Mycenaceae, Porotheleaceae). Today, **Tricholomataceae** is more narrowly defined.

Major genera include:

- _Tricholoma_ (core genus)
- _Leucopaxillus_
- _Pseudotricholoma_
- _Dennisiomyces_

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricales
 ├── Lyophyllaceae
 ├── Mycenaceae
 ├── Porotheleaceae
 └── Tricholomataceae
      ├── Tricholoma
      ├── Leucopaxillus
      └── Pseudotricholoma
```
The family diversified during the Cenozoic with the rise of forest ecosystems, particularly temperate and boreal forests.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors (coniferous and deciduous), woodland edges, mossy clearings.
- **Substrates:** Soil, moss, humus layers, occasionally on rotting wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Predominantly ectomycorrhizal (e.g., _Tricholoma_), but some saprotrophic (e.g., _Leucopaxillus_).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found widely across temperate, subtropical, and boreal regions.

Species often fruit during autumn in rich forest soils, forming mycorrhizal relationships with trees.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Tricholomataceae** fungi have notable ecological and culinary significance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some _Tricholoma_ species (_e.g., Tricholoma matsutake_) are among the most prized edible mushrooms in East Asia.
  - Other species are bitter, inedible, or mildly toxic.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Ectomycorrhizal members play crucial roles in forest nutrient cycling and tree health.
  - Saprotrophic species contribute to soil organic matter decomposition.

- **Economic and cultural importance:**
  - _Tricholoma matsutake_ is a luxury mushroom in Japan and Korea, harvested and sold at high prices.
  - Cultural festivals and traditions often celebrate matsutake season.

Their diversity, ecological partnerships, and culinary fame make Tricholomataceae one of the cornerstone families among gilled mushrooms.
