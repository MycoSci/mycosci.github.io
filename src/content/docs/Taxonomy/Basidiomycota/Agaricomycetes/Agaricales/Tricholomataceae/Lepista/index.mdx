## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lepista nuda_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) Cooke, 1871  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized mushrooms, pinkish to lilac hues, thick fleshy caps, decurrent to adnate gills, white spore prints  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Lepista** was first recognized by **Mordecai Cubitt Cooke** in 1871, refining earlier descriptions by **Elias Magnus Fries**. The name _Lepista_ is derived from Greek _lepís_ ("scale"), possibly referring to the scaly cap surface in some species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lepista** species are robust, colorful mushrooms easily recognized by certain features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat or slightly depressed, often dry and smooth or finely scaly.
  - Colors range from pinkish, lilac, violet, brownish, to pale tan.
  - Gills are adnate to slightly decurrent, pale to creamy, becoming pinkish in some species.
  - Stipes are stout, firm, and often paler than the cap.
  - Spore prints are white to very pale pinkish.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include thick fleshy basidiocarps, pastel to violet shades, white to pale spore prints, and saprotrophic lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) show that **Lepista** is closely related to _Clitocybe_ and _Infundibulicybe_, although some mycologists propose folding _Lepista_ into _Clitocybe_ in a broad sense. However, many still recognize it as a distinct genus due to morphology and ecological preferences.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Tricholomataceae
 ├── Tricholoma
 ├── Clitocybe
 ├── Lepista
 └── Infundibulicybe
```
The genus likely diversified in temperate ecosystems, especially in grassy areas and open forests.

Important species include:

- _Lepista nuda_ (wood blewit)
- _Lepista saeva_ (field blewit)
- _Lepista personata_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, grasslands, gardens, woodland clearings, and pastures.
- **Substrates:** Rich soils, leaf litter, grassy turf, decomposing organic material.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic debris.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widely distributed across temperate and subtropical regions globally.

Species often fruit in late autumn and early winter, forming fairy rings or scattered troops.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lepista** fungi are culturally and gastronomically important:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Lepista nuda_ (wood blewit) and _Lepista saeva_ (field blewit) are popular edible mushrooms when properly cooked.
  - They are prized for their firm texture and rich flavor but must be well-cooked to avoid gastrointestinal upset.

- **Culinary significance:**
  - Used in soups, sautés, and stews.
  - Appreciated for their ability to hold texture during cooking.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers in meadows and woodlands, enhancing soil fertility through organic matter breakdown.

- **Caution:**
  - Potential confusion with toxic _Clitocybe_ species necessitates careful identification.

Their vibrant colors, excellent edibility, and important ecological role make _Lepista_ a beloved genus among mushroom enthusiasts and foragers.
