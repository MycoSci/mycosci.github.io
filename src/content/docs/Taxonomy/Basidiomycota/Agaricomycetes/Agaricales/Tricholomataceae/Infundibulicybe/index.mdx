## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Infundibulicybe gibba_  
* **Authority & year:** Harmaja, 2003  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized mushrooms, deeply funnel-shaped caps, decurrent gills, white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Infundibulicybe** was described by **Harri Harmaja** in 2003 to accommodate species formerly placed within _Clitocybe_ but recognized as genetically distinct. The name comes from Latin _infundibulum_ ("funnel") and _cybe_ ("head"), emphasizing the deeply funnel-shaped caps typical of the group.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Infundibulicybe** species share a very recognizable set of features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are medium-sized to large, broadly funnel-shaped (infundibuliform), often dry and smooth.
  - Colors vary from buff, beige, tan, to pale gray.
  - Gills are decurrent, running well down the stipe, and are white to pale cream.
  - Stipes are slender to moderately thick, fibrous, and often lighter than the cap.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid to broadly oval.
  - Clamp connections are present.

**Synapomorphies** include deeply funnel-shaped caps, decurrent gills, white spores, and a saprotrophic lifestyle.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) clearly separate **Infundibulicybe** from _Clitocybe_ sensu stricto, despite similar gross morphology.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Tricholomataceae
 ├── Tricholoma
 ├── Clitocybe (sensu stricto)
 └── Infundibulicybe
```
The genus likely diversified during the Cenozoic alongside the development of forest floor ecosystems, specializing in decomposition of organic litter.

Important species include:

- _Infundibulicybe gibba_ (common funnel)
- _Infundibulicybe geotropa_ (trooping funnel)
- _Infundibulicybe costata_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, grassy glades, meadows, woodland edges, mossy areas.
- **Substrates:** Leaf litter, decomposing grass, organic-rich soil.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, recycling plant debris.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found widely in temperate forests and grasslands across Europe, North America, Asia, and Australasia.

Species often fruit in troops or fairy rings, especially after heavy autumn rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Infundibulicybe** fungi are moderately important both ecologically and culturally:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Infundibulicybe gibba_ is considered edible when young and fresh, although flavor is often regarded as mediocre.
  - _Infundibulicybe geotropa_ is also edible and sought by foragers but must be carefully distinguished from toxic lookalikes.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers, aiding in organic matter breakdown and nutrient cycling.

- **Caution:**
  - Some lookalikes within _Clitocybe_ (e.g., _Clitocybe dealbata_, _Clitocybe rivulosa_) are dangerously toxic and easily confused with edible _Infundibulicybe_ species by beginners.

Their funnel shapes, ecological roles, and commonness in late-season mushroom foraging make _Infundibulicybe_ a well-known and ecologically significant genus.
