## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Tricholomopsis rutilans_  
* **Authority & year:** (Schaeff.) Singer, 1939  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium to large mushrooms, bright yellow caps with reddish scales, white spore prints, saprotrophic on wood  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Tricholomopsis** was formally described by **Rolf Singer** in 1939, separating certain colorful wood-inhabiting fungi from _Tricholoma_. The name means "resembling _Tricholoma_" (_opsis_ = "appearance"), reflecting both similarities and differences in structure and ecology.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Tricholomopsis** species are striking mushrooms, often brightly colored and wood-loving:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flattened, often bright yellow or golden, with scattered reddish to purplish scales.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to adnexed), close, and pale yellowish to cream.
  - Stipes are central, robust, and often scaly like the cap.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are usually present at hyphal septa.

**Synapomorphies** include vivid coloration, white spore prints, and wood-decaying habits.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) position **Tricholomopsis** within Tricholomataceae but distinct from _Tricholoma_ sensu stricto.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Tricholomataceae
 ├── Tricholoma
 ├── Clitocybe
 ├── Lepista
 ├── Infundibulicybe
 └── Tricholomopsis
```
The genus likely diversified to specialize in colonizing deadwood in coniferous and mixed forests.

Important species include:

- _Tricholomopsis rutilans_ (plums and custard)
- _Tricholomopsis decora_ (decorated wood lover)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Fallen logs, stumps, and dead wood, especially in coniferous forests.
- **Substrates:** Primarily decaying conifer wood; occasionally hardwoods.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down lignocellulosic material.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread in temperate zones across North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species typically fruit in late summer to autumn, often in moist, shaded forest environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Tricholomopsis** fungi are visually striking and ecologically important:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Tricholomopsis rutilans_ is sometimes considered edible, but generally regarded as poor quality due to a tough texture and bland to unpleasant flavor.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important early decomposers of dead conifer wood.
  - Contribute to nutrient recycling and forest ecosystem dynamics.

- **Scientific and cultural relevance:**
  - _Tricholomopsis rutilans_ is a frequent subject of mushroom photography and foraging guides due to its vivid colors.

Their bright, cheerful appearance on decaying wood belies their critical role in the slow process of forest floor renewal.
