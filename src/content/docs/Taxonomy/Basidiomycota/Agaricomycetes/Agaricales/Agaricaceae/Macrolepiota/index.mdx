**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Agaricaceae › **Genus:** Macrolepiota

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Macrolepiota procera_  
* **Authority & year:** Singer, 1948  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Large parasol-like mushrooms, free gills, brown spore prints, tall slender stipe with a moveable annulus  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Macrolepiota** was described by **Rolf Singer** in 1948 to separate larger parasol-like mushrooms from _Lepiota_ and related genera. The name combines the Greek _makros_ ("large") and _lepis_ ("scale"), referring to the large size and scaly appearance of the cap in typical species. Phylogenetic studies have supported _Macrolepiota_ as a distinct lineage within Agaricaceae.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Macrolepiota** species are among the most spectacularly large gilled mushrooms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps can grow up to 30 cm across, initially egg-shaped then expanding broadly.
  - Surface is typically whitish with conspicuous brown to grayish-brown scales.
  - Gills are free from the stipe and white to cream-colored.
  - Stipe is long, slender, with a bulbous base and a distinctive movable annulus (ring).
  - Spore print is white to cream.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, producing four basidiospores.
  - Spores are smooth, ovoid to ellipsoid, hyaline, and non-dextrinoid.
  - Cheilocystidia are present and often crucial for fine-scale identification.

**Synapomorphies** include the large scaly cap, free gills, tall slender stipe with a movable ring, and white spore print.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Macrolepiota** close to _Lepiota_, _Chlorophyllum_, and _Leucoagaricus_ but clearly distinct based on size, ecology, and spore characters.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricaceae
 ├── Agaricus
 ├── Lepiota
 ├── Macrolepiota
 ├── Chlorophyllum
 └── Leucoagaricus
```
The genus likely radiated alongside the expansion of grasslands and open woodlands during the late Cretaceous and Cenozoic periods.

Important species include:

- _Macrolepiota procera_ (parasol mushroom)
- _Macrolepiota mastoidea_
- _Macrolepiota excoriata_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, meadows, pastures, forest edges, sometimes in gardens or along roadsides.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in organic matter.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing dead plant debris.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed throughout temperate regions of Europe, North America, Asia, Australasia, and parts of South America.

Typically fruits in late summer to autumn after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Macrolepiota** mushrooms are highly regarded for their culinary value:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Macrolepiota procera_ is a prized edible mushroom known for its nutty, meaty flavor.
  - Only young, firm specimens should be collected; caution is advised to avoid confusion with toxic lookalikes (e.g., some _Chlorophyllum_ species).

- **Culinary uses:**
  - Caps are often grilled, breaded, and fried or used in soups and stews.
  - The slender stems are often too fibrous to eat but may be dried for flavoring.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important recyclers of organic debris in open ecosystems.

- **Cautionary notes:**
  - Beginners must be cautious; immature _Amanita_ species can superficially resemble parasol mushrooms when young.

Because of their size, beauty, and edibility, _Macrolepiota_ species are favorites among foragers and mushroom enthusiasts.
