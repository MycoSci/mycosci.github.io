# Chlorophyllum <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Agaricaceae › **Genus:** Chlorophyllum

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Chlorophyllum molybdites_  
* **Authority & year:** Massee, 1898  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Large fleshy mushrooms, greenish or white spore prints, free gills, partial veil forming an annulus, grassland or urban habitats  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Chlorophyllum** was described by **George Edward Massee** in 1898. The name comes from the Greek _chloros_ ("green") and _phyllon_ ("leaf" or "gill"), referencing the greenish tint of the spore print seen in species like _Chlorophyllum molybdites_. Originally lumped with _Lepiota_ and _Macrolepiota_, molecular studies justified the separation of _Chlorophyllum_ as its own genus within Agaricaceae.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Chlorophyllum** species are robust, often showy mushrooms with several defining features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are large, often exceeding 10 cm in diameter, scaly or smooth, typically white, brown, or grayish.
  - Gills are free from the stipe, initially white, becoming greenish or staying white depending on the species.
  - Stipe (stem) is usually robust, often with a moveable or fixed ring (annulus).
  - Spore prints are green, greenish-white, or white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, ellipsoid to ovoid, and often greenish in mature specimens of toxic species.
  - Cheilocystidia and pileocystidia are important for species-level identifications.

**Synapomorphies** include large stature, free gills, robust annulus, and spore color variations (especially greenish in _C. molybdites_).

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2) support **Chlorophyllum** as a monophyletic genus distinct from _Macrolepiota_ and _Lepiota_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricaceae
 ├── Agaricus
 ├── Lepiota
 ├── Macrolepiota
 ├── Chlorophyllum
 └── Leucoagaricus
```
_Chlorophyllum_ likely evolved relatively recently in evolutionary terms, specializing in open, disturbed environments.

Notable species include:

- _Chlorophyllum molybdites_ (green-spored parasol; toxic)
- _Chlorophyllum brunneum_ (edible but sometimes confused with toxic relatives)
- _Chlorophyllum rhacodes_ (shaggy parasol; edible for some)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, lawns, gardens, parklands, disturbed soils, sometimes forest edges.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in organic matter; occasionally on compost or dung-enriched areas.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic matter.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread in tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones; particularly abundant in urban and suburban areas.

_Chlorophyllum molybdites_ is notorious in warm regions such as the southeastern United States and Australia, often fruiting in large fairy rings.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Chlorophyllum** species are important for both practical and cautionary reasons:

- **Edibility and toxicity:**
  - _Chlorophyllum molybdites_ is responsible for a high number of mushroom poisoning cases worldwide due to its resemblance to edible parasol mushrooms; symptoms include severe gastrointestinal distress.
  - Other species, such as _C. rhacodes_ (when properly identified), are considered edible and prized by some foragers.

- **Economic and ecological impact:**
  - Decomposers aiding in nutrient cycling in urban green spaces.
  - Public health importance due to frequent misidentifications leading to poisoning cases.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Often discussed in mushroom foraging communities as a cautionary example of the risks associated with misidentifying large, attractive mushrooms.

Accurate identification within _Chlorophyllum_ is critical, especially for novice foragers.
