## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Agaricus campestris_ (for the type genus _Agaricus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Chevallier, 1826  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gilled mushrooms, free or attached gills, brown to pink spore prints, fleshy basidiocarps, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Agaricaceae** was established by **François Fulgis Chevallier** in 1826. It is based on the genus _Agaricus_, whose name stems from Latin meaning "field mushroom," reflecting the habitat of many early-recognized species. Historically, Agaricaceae included nearly all gilled mushrooms, but modern molecular phylogenetics has narrowed the family's definition, centering it around species with brownish or pinkish spore prints and particular microscopic traits.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Agaricaceae** species are among the most familiar and economically important mushrooms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Basidiocarps typically have a distinct cap (pileus) and stalk (stipe).
  - Gills (lamellae) beneath the cap are free or narrowly attached to the stipe.
  - Spore prints are typically chocolate-brown, dark brown, or pinkish-brown.
  - Universal or partial veils often present, sometimes forming an annulus (ring) around the stipe.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, bearing four spores externally.
  - Spores are smooth or ornamented, often ellipsoid, and pigmented (brown shades).
  - Cheilocystidia (specialized sterile cells on gill edges) are often diagnostic.

**Synapomorphies** include free gills, brown to pink spore prints, and fleshy fruiting bodies.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) confirm **Agaricaceae** as a monophyletic family within Agaricales, although it has undergone major redefinition in the molecular era.

Major genera within Agaricaceae include:

- _Agaricus_ (button mushrooms and relatives)
- _Lepiota_
- _Macrolepiota_ (parasol mushrooms)
- _Chlorophyllum_ (some poisonous look-alikes)
- _Leucoagaricus_

The evolutionary radiation of Agaricaceae likely occurred during the Cretaceous and early Paleogene periods, adapting to grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed soils.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, forests, gardens, compost heaps, dung, and disturbed soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil, organic debris, dung (coprophilous species).
- **Trophic modes:** Predominantly saprotrophic, decomposing dead organic material.

- **Geographic range:** Global; Agaricaceae species occur on every continent except Antarctica.

Many species thrive in human-disturbed environments, making them among the most recognizable fungi worldwide.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Agaricaceae** fungi have enormous culinary, ecological, and economic importance:

- **Edible species:**
  - _Agaricus bisporus_ (white button mushroom, cremini, portobello).
  - _Macrolepiota procera_ (parasol mushroom).

- **Toxic species:**
  - _Chlorophyllum molybdites_ ("green-spored parasol") causes gastrointestinal poisoning and is a common cause of mushroom poisoning in North America.

- **Economic importance:**
  - _Agaricus bisporus_ is the most widely cultivated mushroom species globally, underpinning a multi-billion dollar mushroom industry.

- **Ecological impact:**
  - Decompose organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling.
  - Some species are pioneers in disturbed habitats, stabilizing soil ecosystems.

- **Cultural significance:**
  - Mushrooms of Agaricaceae feature in folklore, cuisine, and mushroom hunting traditions worldwide.

Their diversity, utility, and familiarity make the Agaricaceae one of the best-known fungal families both scientifically and culturally.
