## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Panaeolus papilionaceus_  
* **Authority & year:** Quélet, 1872  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized mushrooms, mottled gills, dark spore prints, saprotrophic, often dung-associated  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Panaeolus** was described by **Lucien Quélet** in 1872. The name derives from Greek _panaiolos_ ("entirely variegated" or "all mottled"), referring to the patchy, uneven maturation of spores across the gills, giving a speckled appearance. These mushrooms are closely associated with nutrient-rich soils and dung, earning them the nickname "mottlegills."

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Panaeolus** species are typically identified by their unique gill and spore characteristics:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Small to medium-sized mushrooms with thin to fleshy caps, often hemispherical to bell-shaped when young, flattening with age.
  - Gills are attached to free, gray at first, becoming mottled dark gray to black as spores mature unevenly.
  - Spore print is black to dark purplish-black.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, bearing four spores.
  - Spores are smooth, ellipsoid to lemon-shaped, jet black at maturity.
  - Cheilocystidia are often present and useful in species differentiation.

**Synapomorphies** include black spore prints and distinctly mottled gills during spore maturation.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Panaeolus** firmly within the Bolbitiaceae, closely allied to genera like _Conocybe_ and _Bolbitius_ but distinct in spore color and gill development.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

 ├── Panaeolus
 └── Panaeolina
```
The genus likely diversified alongside grassland and dung-rich ecosystems during the expansion of grazing mammals.

Important species include:

- _Panaeolus papilionaceus_ (bell-shaped mottlegill)
- _Panaeolus cinctulus_ (banded mottlegill)
- _Panaeolus cyanescens_ (blue-staining species, psychoactive)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, pastures, lawns, and dung-enriched soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil, decomposing grass, animal dung (especially horse and cow dung).
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, rapidly decomposing organic-rich substrates.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; species found on all continents, with many thriving in tropical and subtropical climates.

Many species fruit prolifically after rains and warm temperatures.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Panaeolus** fungi are ecologically significant and culturally notable:

- **Edibility and psychoactivity:**
  - Some species like _Panaeolus cyanescens_ contain psilocybin and are psychoactive, playing important roles in indigenous traditions and modern psychopharmacology.
  - Other species are non-toxic but not particularly valued for food.

- **Legal and cultural status:**
  - Psilocybin-containing _Panaeolus_ species are controlled substances in many countries.
  - Interest in psychedelic fungi for therapeutic uses (e.g., depression, PTSD) has increased research attention.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Efficient decomposers in nutrient cycles, particularly in dung-based ecosystems.

- **Cautionary notes:**
  - Accurate identification is essential; while many _Panaeolus_ species are non-toxic, some may be confused with toxic LBMs (little brown mushrooms).

_Panaeolus_ remains one of the most important genera for studies of fungal psychoactivity, ecology, and rapid colonization of disturbed habitats.
