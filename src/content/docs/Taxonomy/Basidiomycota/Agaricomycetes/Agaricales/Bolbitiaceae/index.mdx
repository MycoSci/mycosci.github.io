**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Bolbitiaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Bolbitius vitellinus_ (for the type genus _Bolbitius_)  
* **Authority & year:** Fries, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized mushrooms, thin fragile flesh, cinnamon to rusty brown spore prints, saprotrophic on dung, grass, and wood debris  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Bolbitiaceae** was established by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1821, originally encompassing a broad range of fragile, brown-spored mushrooms. The name is derived from the type genus _Bolbitius_, itself meaning "lump" or "bubble," in reference to the delicate, often gelatinous caps of species like _Bolbitius titubans_. Subsequent molecular studies have refined Bolbitiaceae’s circumscription within Agaricales.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Bolbitiaceae** fungi are delicate, often short-lived, and easily distinguished by:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are usually thin-fleshed, fragile, and often brightly colored (yellow, orange, or brownish), fading quickly with age.
  - Gills are adnexed to free, and color from pale to dark cinnamon as spores mature.
  - Spore print colors are typically cinnamon, ochre, rusty, or reddish-brown.
  - Stipes are slender, often fragile, and sometimes with a flimsy ring or veil remnants.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, producing four basidiospores.
  - Spores are smooth to minutely roughened, ellipsoid, and colored (not hyaline) at maturity.
  - Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia are often prominent and diagnostic.

**Synapomorphies** include fragile basidiocarps, cinnamon- to rust-colored spore prints, and a saprotrophic lifestyle.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) confirm that **Bolbitiaceae** is monophyletic and closely related to other brown-spored families like Psathyrellaceae.

Major genera within Bolbitiaceae include:

- _Bolbitius_ (e.g., _Bolbitius titubans_)
- _Conocybe_ (e.g., _Conocybe tenera_)
- _Pholiotina_ (e.g., _Pholiotina rugosa_)
- _Descolea_ (mostly Southern Hemisphere)

The group likely diversified during the Cretaceous alongside grassland and savanna ecosystems.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, meadows, pastures, woodchip beds, lawns, and sometimes decaying wood.
- **Substrates:** Soil, dung, plant debris, wood chips, and mossy areas.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing dead organic matter, often quickly colonizing nutrient-rich substrates.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions.

Many species fruit rapidly after rainfall, appearing and withering within hours to days.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Bolbitiaceae** fungi are ecologically important but generally of minor economic significance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Bolbitius titubans_) are technically edible when very young but not considered worthwhile due to insubstantial flesh and poor culinary quality.
  - Caution is advised because some _Conocybe_ and _Pholiotina_ species contain dangerous toxins (e.g., amatoxins), leading to severe or fatal poisoning.

- **Ecological role:**
  - Important rapid recyclers of organic nutrients in grassland and open habitats.
  - Play a role in nutrient turnover on dung and wood debris.

- **Cautionary notes:**
  - Small brown mushrooms (colloquially "LBMs"—little brown mushrooms) are notoriously difficult to identify safely, and some Bolbitiaceae species can be easily confused with deadly species.

Their ephemeral, delicate beauty and vital ecological role as decomposers make Bolbitiaceae an interesting but often overlooked family of fungi.
