# Schizophyllaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Schizophyllaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Schizophyllum commune_ (for the type genus _Schizophyllum_)  
* **Authority & year:** D.A. Reid, 1965  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small, fan-shaped to shell-like mushrooms, split gills, tough texture, white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Schizophyllaceae** was formally established by **Derek A. Reid** in 1965. The name is based on the type genus _Schizophyllum_, from Greek _schizo_ ("to split") and _phyllon_ ("leaf" or "gill"), referring to the unique longitudinally split gills that can open and close based on humidity.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Schizophyllaceae** fungi are distinctive both macroscopically and microscopically:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are small, fan-shaped, kidney-shaped, or oyster-like.
  - Surfaces are often densely hairy or woolly, usually whitish to grayish.
  - Gills are split longitudinally, giving a "double-edged" appearance.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored, but uniquely longitudinally septate (partitioned internally).
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are common at hyphal septa.

**Synapomorphies** include split gills, longitudinally septate basidia, white spores, and saprotrophic wood decomposition.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Schizophyllaceae** securely within Agaricales, distinct from true oyster fungi (e.g., _Pleurotus_ in Pleurotaceae) despite superficial similarities.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricales
 ├── Pleurotaceae
 ├── Omphalotaceae
 └── Schizophyllaceae
      └── Schizophyllum
```
The family likely evolved to specialize in wood decomposition under variable moisture conditions, with gill-splitting serving as an adaptation to desiccation and rehydration.

Only one widely recognized genus:

- _Schizophyllum_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Decaying wood, fallen logs, stumps, and branches, especially in exposed and disturbed sites.
- **Substrates:** Dead hardwoods and softwoods.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing lignocellulosic material.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; among the most widely distributed fungi, occurring in both temperate and tropical zones worldwide.

Fruiting bodies persist year-round, often reviving from dormancy after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Schizophyllaceae** fungi are ecologically vital and scientifically notable:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Schizophyllum commune_ is edible when young in some cultures (e.g., parts of Asia) but generally considered too tough for widespread culinary use.

- **Medical relevance:**
  - _Schizophyllum commune_ has been implicated as an opportunistic human pathogen, causing rare but serious infections (e.g., sinusitis, pneumonia) in immunocompromised individuals.

- **Scientific importance:**
  - Extensively studied for genetics, mating systems (over 20,000 mating types), and wood degradation enzymes.
  - A model organism for basidiomycete biology.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major decomposer of wood, aiding nutrient cycling and forest ecosystem maintenance.

Their tough, resilient fruitbodies and remarkable biological traits make Schizophyllaceae one of the most fascinating families in fungal biodiversity.
