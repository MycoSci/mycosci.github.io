## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Schizophyllum commune_  
* **Authority & year:** Fr., 1815  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small, fan-shaped mushrooms, split gills, tough hairy caps, white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Schizophyllum** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1815. The name is derived from Greek _schizo_ ("to split") and _phyllon_ ("leaf" or "gill"), a direct reference to the distinctive longitudinally split gills that separate and close depending on moisture levels.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Schizophyllum** species are highly recognizable and adapted for resilience:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are small, fan-shaped, shell-like, or semicircular.
  - Cap surfaces are densely hairy or woolly, white to grayish in color.
  - Gills are deeply split longitudinally (a unique feature among fungi) and appear "double-edged."
  - Stipes are absent or very rudimentary.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored, but longitudinally septate (divided by internal walls).
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are common.

**Synapomorphies** include split gills, tough and hairy caps, white spores, and the ability to survive desiccation and rehydrate.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Schizophyllum** as the sole genus of Schizophyllaceae, deeply distinct from oyster-like mushrooms despite some superficial resemblance.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Schizophyllaceae
 └── Schizophyllum
```
The genus likely evolved as a moisture-adapted group specializing in wood decomposition in diverse climates.

Important species:

- _Schizophyllum commune_ (the cosmopolitan "split-gill fungus")

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead wood, fallen logs, tree stumps, branches, and occasionally construction wood.
- **Substrates:** Primarily hardwoods and sometimes softwoods.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing lignified plant materials.

- **Geographic range:** Truly cosmopolitan; found from tropical rainforests to temperate and even semi-arid environments on all continents except Antarctica.

Fruiting bodies often persist through dry seasons, reactivating after rain.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Schizophyllum** fungi have unique ecological and scientific importance:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Schizophyllum commune_ is eaten in parts of Asia, particularly in Thailand and Laos, but it is generally too tough for widespread culinary use in Western cultures.

- **Medical relevance:**
  - _S. commune_ is a known opportunistic pathogen, capable of causing rare but serious infections (e.g., sinusitis, pulmonary infections) in immunocompromised individuals.

- **Scientific significance:**
  - Extensively studied as a model organism for:
    - Basidiomycete genetics and mating systems (over 20,000 mating types).
    - Wood degradation enzymes.
    - Desiccation resistance and rehydration biology.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - An essential early decomposer of fallen wood, contributing to nutrient cycling and forest health.

Their extraordinary resilience, biological complexity, and worldwide distribution make _Schizophyllum_ one of the most remarkable fungal genera.
