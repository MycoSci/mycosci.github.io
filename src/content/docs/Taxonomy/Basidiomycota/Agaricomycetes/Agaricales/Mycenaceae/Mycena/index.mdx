## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Mycena galericulata_  
* **Authority & year:** (Scopoli) Gray, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Tiny to small mushrooms, bell- to conical-shaped caps, white spore prints, fragile stems, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Mycena** was formally described by **Samuel Frederick Gray** in 1821, based on earlier work by **Giovanni Antonio Scopoli**. The name _Mycena_ possibly references "smallness" or "fragility," aligning with the dainty, delicate form of these forest mushrooms.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Mycena** species are characterized by their petite stature and elegant form:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are usually conical, bell-shaped, or occasionally expanded, often semi-translucent when moist (hygrophanous).
  - Colors range from white, gray, brown, pink, to vivid reds, blues, or greens in some tropical species.
  - Stipes are thin, long relative to the cap size, brittle, and often translucent or pruinose (powdery).
  - Gills are attached (adnate to adnexed) and typically whitish to pale.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Cystidia are often elaborately shaped and are important for species-level identification.

**Synapomorphies** include small size, fragile bodies, white spores, and a saprotrophic lifestyle.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) position **Mycena** securely within Mycenaceae, related to genera like _Panellus_ and _Resinomycena_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

_Mycena_ is an ancient lineage, likely diversifying alongside the proliferation of forest ecosystems during the Cenozoic.

Important species include:

- _Mycena galericulata_ (common bonnet)
- _Mycena pura_ (lilac bonnet)
- _Mycena chlorophos_ (bioluminescent mushroom)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, leaf litter, mossy logs, decaying wood, and sometimes in grasslands or heathlands.
- **Substrates:** Decaying plant matter, fallen leaves, rotten wood, moss.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic debris and promoting soil formation.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found across temperate, tropical, subtropical, and boreal ecosystems.

Many species prefer moist, shaded habitats and appear prolifically after rainfall.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Mycena** fungi, though small, are culturally and scientifically significant:

- **Bioluminescence:**
  - Several species (e.g., _Mycena chlorophos_, _Mycena lux-coeli_) produce light through luciferin-luciferase reactions, attracting great interest for research into fungal biochemistry and natural illumination.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Play a major role in leaf litter and wood decomposition, vital for forest nutrient cycling.
  - Some species associate loosely with mosses or in specialized microhabitats.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Their delicate beauty and glowing species have been celebrated in art, photography, and science outreach.
  - Featured in eco-tourism programs, especially in regions where bioluminescent species occur.

Although rarely edible and usually overlooked by foragers, _Mycena_ species are ecological gems in the fungal world.
