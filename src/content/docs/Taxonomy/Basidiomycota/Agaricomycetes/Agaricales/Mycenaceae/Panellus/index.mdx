## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Panellus stipticus_  
* **Authority & year:** (Persoon) Karsten, 1879  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small wood-inhabiting mushrooms, often laterally attached, white spore prints, some species bioluminescent  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Panellus** was formally described by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1879, based on earlier work by **Christiaan Hendrik Persoon**. The name _Panellus_ diminishes _Panus_ ("broad dish"), referring to the small, fan-shaped fruiting bodies often found growing laterally from wood.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Panellus** species exhibit distinct features adapted to life on wood:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are small to medium-sized, often fan-shaped, semicircular, or kidney-shaped.
  - Caps are usually smooth or slightly hairy, sometimes hygrophanous (changing color when drying).
  - Gills are radiating from a lateral or off-center point of attachment.
  - Stipes are rudimentary or absent.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid.
  - Cheilocystidia are often abundant and diagnostically useful.

**Synapomorphies** include lateral attachment to wood, white spores, and delicate fan-shaped fruitbodies.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Panellus** as a core genus within Mycenaceae, allied with _Mycena_ and _Resinomycena_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Mycenaceae
 ├── Mycena
 ├── Panellus
 ├── Resinomycena
 └── Cruentomycena
```
The genus diversified primarily in forested ecosystems, specializing in wood decomposition.

Important species include:

- _Panellus stipticus_ (bioluminescent species)
- _Panellus serotinus_ (late fall oyster)
- _Panellus ringens_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests, woodlands, fallen logs, dead stumps, and woody debris.
- **Substrates:** Dead hardwood or softwood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, efficiently decomposing lignified plant materials.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; especially common in temperate forests but also found in tropical and boreal regions.

Species often fruit prolifically after rains and are adapted to shaded, moist environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Panellus** fungi are important both ecologically and scientifically:

- **Bioluminescence:**
  - _Panellus stipticus_ is one of the best-known bioluminescent fungi, producing faint greenish light via luciferase-driven enzymatic reactions.
  - This glow, though weak, is visible in complete darkness and has been studied for biological light production.

- **Edibility:**
  - Most species are not considered edible due to tough texture or insubstantial flesh.
  - _Panellus serotinus_ (late fall oyster) is edible after careful preparation but varies regionally in culinary appreciation.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Crucial for nutrient recycling in forest ecosystems by breaking down woody debris.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Bioluminescent _Panellus_ species inspire fascination in naturalists and are used in science communication and educational programs.

Their modest size but ecological and visual impact make _Panellus_ a fascinating genus among wood-inhabiting fungi.
