## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hygrocybe conica_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) P. Kummer, 1871  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium mushrooms, vivid colors (red, yellow, orange), waxy gills, white spore prints, sensitive grassland indicators  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Hygrocybe** was formalized by **Paul Kummer** in 1871, refining earlier work by **Elias Magnus Fries**. The name combines Greek _hygros_ ("moist") and _kybe_ ("head"), referencing the moist or greasy appearance of the caps. _Hygrocybe_ species are among the most iconic and colorful mushrooms of temperate grasslands and mossy forests.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hygrocybe** species are characterized by striking colors and waxy textures:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are conical to bell-shaped or convex, often brightly colored (scarlet, yellow, orange, pink).
  - Surfaces can be dry or slightly greasy but are never truly slimy (unlike _Gliophorus_).
  - Gills are thick, waxy, and often widely spaced.
  - Stipes are often slender, smooth, and colored similarly to the cap.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are common in most species.

**Synapomorphies** include waxy gills, bright colors, smooth hyaline spores, and a white spore print.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) confirm **Hygrocybe** as a core genus within Hygrophoraceae, although some former members have been moved to related genera like _Gliophorus_ and _Cuphophyllus_.

_Hygrocybe_ species likely diversified during the Cenozoic, adapting to low-nutrient soils in ancient grasslands and mossy forests.

Important species include:

- _Hygrocybe conica_ (blackening waxcap)
- _Hygrocybe coccinea_ (scarlet waxcap)
- _Hygrocybe chlorophana_ (golden waxcap)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Unimproved grasslands, mossy lawns, heathlands, and forest edges.
- **Substrates:** Soil low in nutrients; often in moss-rich environments.
- **Trophic modes:** Likely biotrophic or weakly saprotrophic (nutritional modes still under active study).

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed in temperate regions, with hotspots in Europe, North America, Australasia, and parts of South America.

Waxcaps, including _Hygrocybe_, are particularly sensitive to soil nutrient enrichment and habitat disturbance.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hygrocybe** fungi are beloved by mycologists, conservationists, and photographers:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Hygrocybe coccinea_, _H. pratensis_) are considered edible, though often too small or delicate for major culinary use.
  - Always exercise caution, as waxcap mushrooms are often protected or rare.

- **Conservation importance:**
  - Waxcap grasslands are recognized as important conservation targets across Europe and elsewhere.
  - _Hygrocybe_ species serve as flagship fungi for the preservation of ancient, unimproved grasslands.

- **Cultural impact:**
  - Celebrated in field guides and nature photography for their brilliant colors.
  - Featured in biodiversity action plans and fungal conservation literature.

Their dazzling forms and ecological sensitivity make _Hygrocybe_ one of the most iconic genera in fungal conservation efforts worldwide.
