## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lichenomphalia umbellifera_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) Redhead, Lutzoni, Moncalvo & Vilgalys, 2002  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small agaricoid or crustose lichens, green algal photobiont, white spore prints, biotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Lichenomphalia** was described by **Scott Redhead**, **François Lutzoni**, **Jean-Marc Moncalvo**, and **Rytas Vilgalys** in 2002 after molecular studies showed that certain lichenized "mushroom-like" fungi were distinct from traditional non-lichenized basidiomycetes. The name combines "lichen" and "_Omphalia_" (a former genus name), emphasizing the fungal-lichen symbiosis and small, navel-shaped caps.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lichenomphalia** species are unique among agarics for their lichenized lifestyle:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruitbodies are small, mushroom-like (agaricoid) with convex to umbilicate (navel-shaped) caps.
  - Color varies from pale cream to brownish or greenish hues.
  - Gills are decurrent and often pale or translucent.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Associated green algae (photobionts) are embedded in a crustose to granular thallus surrounding the base of the stipe or on the substrate.

**Synapomorphies** include lichenization (association with green algae) and typical basidiomycete reproductive structures.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Lichenomphalia** securely within Hygrophoraceae, representing a rare example of lichenization in an otherwise mushroom-forming family.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Hygrophoraceae
 ├── Hygrophorus
 ├── Hygrocybe
 ├── Gliophorus
 ├── Cuphophyllus
 └── Lichenomphalia
```
_Lichenomphalia_ likely evolved lichenization independently from other lichen-forming basidiomycetes like _Multiclavula_ (Cantharellales).

Important species include:

- _Lichenomphalia umbellifera_ (widespread type species)
- _Lichenomphalia alpina_
- _Lichenomphalia hudsoniana_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Mossy soils, tundra, heathlands, alpine and arctic environments, forest floors.
- **Substrates:** Soil, moss, decomposing organic matter, often in nutrient-poor conditions.
- **Trophic modes:** Biotrophic (lichenized); mutualistic association with photosynthetic algae.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; especially abundant in cold, moist, and high-altitude habitats.

Species are frequently indicators of intact, low-nutrient ecosystems.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lichenomphalia** fungi are scientifically significant but not of economic importance:

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Contribute to soil stability and early successional soil development, especially in cold or disturbed ecosystems.
  - Serve as pioneers in alpine, tundra, and recently deglaciated soils.

- **Research interest:**
  - Studied for insights into the evolution of lichenization within Basidiomycota.
  - Important in understanding fungal-algal symbiotic relationships.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Sensitive to habitat degradation, climate change, and atmospheric pollution (lichenized fungi are bioindicators).

Their blend of mushroom and lichen characteristics makes _Lichenomphalia_ one of the most fascinating genera bridging fungal and lichenized lifeforms.
