## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Gliophorus laetus_  
* **Authority & year:** Herink, 1958  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small, slimy-capped mushrooms, waxy thick gills, bright or pastel colors, white spore prints, saprotrophic or biotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Gliophorus** was described by **Josef Herink** in 1958 to accommodate waxcap mushrooms with notably slimy (glutinous) surfaces. The name combines Greek _glia_ ("glue") and _phoros_ ("bearing"), referring to the characteristic sticky texture of the cap and stipe in moist conditions.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Gliophorus** species are unmistakable in the field due to their vivid colors and slimy texture:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are smooth, viscid to glutinous, and often brightly colored (orange, pink, green, violet).
  - Gills are thick, widely spaced, waxy, and sometimes translucent.
  - Stipes are slender, often similarly viscid.
  - Spore print is white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include glutinous surfaces, waxy gills, bright colors, and smooth hyaline spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Gliophorus** as a distinct lineage within **Hygrophoraceae**, closely related to _Hygrocybe_ but differentiated by its slimy fruitbody surfaces.

_Gliophorus_ likely diversified in moist grassland and forest edge environments where conditions favor slimy protective coatings.

Important species include:

- _Gliophorus laetus_ (Heath waxcap)
- _Gliophorus psittacinus_ (Parrot waxcap)
- _Gliophorus irrigatus_ (Slimy waxcap)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist grasslands, mossy meadows, and forest clearings.
- **Substrates:** Soil and moss; sometimes decomposing fine plant debris.
- **Trophic modes:** 
  - Saprotrophic or weakly biotrophic (exact nutrient mode in waxcap fungi remains partially unresolved).

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across temperate regions in Europe, North America, Asia, Australasia, and parts of South America.

Most species prefer unimproved, low-nutrient grasslands with little fertilizer disturbance.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Gliophorus** fungi are crucial components of waxcap grassland communities:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Gliophorus psittacinus_) are technically edible but very slimy and small, thus rarely collected for food.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Serve as bioindicators of ancient, semi-natural grasslands and ecosystem integrity.
  - Sensitive to agricultural intensification and soil nutrient enrichment.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Highlighted in European Important Fungus Areas (IFA) projects and national red lists.
  - Protecting waxcap-rich grasslands preserves a significant portion of fungal biodiversity.

Their brilliant colors and delicate forms make _Gliophorus_ among the most beloved fungi for photographers and conservationists.
