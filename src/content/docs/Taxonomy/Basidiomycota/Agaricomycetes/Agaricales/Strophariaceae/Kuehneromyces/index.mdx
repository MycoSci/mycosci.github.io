## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Kuehneromyces mutabilis_  
* **Authority & year:** Singer & A.H. Smith, 1946  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized mushrooms, hygrophanous brown caps, dark brown spore prints, saprotrophic on wood  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Kuehneromyces** was established by **Rolf Singer** and **Alexander H. Smith** in 1946. It honors **Robert Kühner**, a notable French mycologist, and incorporates _myces_ ("fungus") to denote its fungal nature.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Kuehneromyces** species are classic wood-inhabiting saprotrophs:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to plane, strongly hygrophanous (changing color with moisture), typically honey-brown when moist and paler when dry.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to slightly decurrent), becoming dark brown with maturity.
  - Stipes are tough, often with a fibrous texture and a faint ring zone or veil remnants.
  - Spore prints are dark brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, dark brown, ellipsoid to subglobose, often with a small germ pore.
  - Cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia are frequently present and helpful for species-level identification.

**Synapomorphies** include hygrophanous brown caps, dark spore prints, and a strong preference for decaying wood.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Kuehneromyces** within Strophariaceae, related to genera such as _Hypholoma_ and _Stropharia_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Strophariaceae
 ├── Stropharia
 ├── Hypholoma
 ├── Agrocybe
 └── Kuehneromyces
```
The genus likely diversified with the spread of temperate woodlands and broadleaf forests, exploiting decaying wood substrates.

Key species include:

- _Kuehneromyces mutabilis_ (sheathed woodtuft)
- _Kuehneromyces lignicola_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Fallen logs, stumps, rotting wood, occasionally woody debris in forests and gardens.
- **Substrates:** Dead hardwoods primarily, sometimes softwoods.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, playing a significant role in wood decomposition.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread in temperate regions of Europe, North America, and Asia.

Species are often found fruiting prolifically after rains, particularly in spring and autumn.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Kuehneromyces** fungi have modest culinary and strong ecological significance:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Kuehneromyces mutabilis_ is considered a good edible mushroom in Europe, known for its pleasant flavor and texture, but care must be taken to distinguish it from toxic lookalikes like _Galerina marginata_.
  - Proper identification is crucial before consumption.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers of dead wood, contributing to nutrient cycling and forest floor ecosystem maintenance.

- **Scientific and educational relevance:**
  - Used as a model for teaching wood decay succession and fungal morphology in mycological courses.

Their variable coloration, ecological importance, and cautionary role in mushroom foraging make _Kuehneromyces_ a notable genus among wood-inhabiting fungi.
