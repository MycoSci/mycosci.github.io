## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Pholiota squarrosa_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) P. Kummer, 1871  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized mushrooms, scaly caps, brown to rusty-brown spore prints, saprotrophic on wood  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Pholiota** was established by **Paul Kummer** in 1871, following earlier work by **Elias Magnus Fries**. The name comes from Greek _pholis_ ("scale"), referring to the often scaly texture of the cap surfaces in many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Pholiota** species are sturdy, wood-associated mushrooms with clear identifying features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, often viscid (sticky) when wet and covered with prominent scales.
  - Colors range from yellowish-brown, golden, to rusty or olive tones.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to adnexed), becoming rusty-brown as spores mature.
  - Stipes are typically robust, often featuring remnants of a partial veil (a ring or cortina).
  - Spore prints are brown to rusty-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, ellipsoid to subglobose, brown in deposit.
  - Chrysocystidia (large refractive cystidia) are usually present and important for species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include scaly or viscid caps, rusty-brown spores, and wood-decaying habits.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Pholiota** as part of Strophariaceae, closely related to _Stropharia_ and _Hypholoma_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Strophariaceae
 ├── Stropharia
 ├── Hypholoma
 ├── Agrocybe
 └── Pholiota
```
The genus likely diversified in temperate forest ecosystems, specializing in lignin-rich wood decomposition.

Important species include:

- _Pholiota squarrosa_ (shaggy scalycap)
- _Pholiota aurivella_ (golden pholiota)
- _Pholiota highlandensis_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Decaying hardwood and conifer logs, stumps, and roots; sometimes living trees.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead wood; occasionally parasitic on weakened trees.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic or weakly parasitic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; common across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia.

Species are typically seen fruiting in autumn and early winter, often after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Pholiota** fungi are primarily of ecological importance, though some are culturally noted:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Pholiota nameko_, cultivated mainly in Asia) are edible and commercially produced for soups and stews.
  - Many wild _Pholiota_ species are considered inedible or mildly toxic, often causing gastrointestinal upset.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Major decomposers of lignified material in forests.
  - Their saprotrophic action helps sustain nutrient cycling in dead wood environments.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Serve as study models for wood decay processes and fungal ecology.

Their handsome, scaly caps and critical ecological role as wood recyclers make _Pholiota_ an important genus in temperate forest ecosystems.
