## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hypholoma fasciculare_  
* **Authority & year:** (Huds.) P. Kummer, 1871  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Clustered wood-inhabiting mushrooms, yellow to greenish caps, dark purplish-brown spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Hypholoma** was defined by **Paul Kummer** in 1871, refining species earlier placed under _Agaricus_ by early mycologists. The name is derived from Greek _hypho-_ ("web") and _loma_ ("fringe" or "edge"), referring to the somewhat fibrillose (webby) partial veil remnants sometimes seen at the cap margin.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hypholoma** species are distinctive cluster-fruiting mushrooms often seen on dead wood:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flattened, sticky when moist, often bright yellow, greenish, brownish, or tan.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to adnexed), initially pale gray, darkening to purplish-brown with maturity.
  - Stipes are central, pale to yellowish, sometimes darker at the base.
  - Spore prints are dark purplish-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, dark-colored, ellipsoid to broadly ovate, often with a germ pore.
  - Cheilocystidia are often abundant and varied.

**Synapomorphies** include clustered growth on wood, dark purple-brown spore prints, and often yellowish or brightly colored caps.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Hypholoma** securely within Strophariaceae, alongside _Stropharia_, _Pholiota_, and _Agrocybe_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Strophariaceae
 ├── Stropharia
 ├── Pholiota
 ├── Agrocybe
 └── Hypholoma
```
The genus likely diversified in temperate forests, specializing in the rapid colonization and decay of dead wood.

Important species include:

- _Hypholoma fasciculare_ (sulfur tuft)
- _Hypholoma capnoides_ (smoky gilled woodlover)
- _Hypholoma lateritium_ (brick cap)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Fallen logs, stumps, dead roots, buried wood in forests, parks, and gardens.
- **Substrates:** Primarily decaying hardwoods, sometimes conifers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, rapidly decomposing lignified material.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across temperate regions, particularly common in Europe, North America, and Asia.

Species typically fruit in dense clusters during autumn, but some also fruit earlier depending on climate.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hypholoma** fungi are ecologically critical and culturally noted:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Hypholoma capnoides_ is considered edible and mild-tasting.
  - _Hypholoma fasciculare_ is **toxic**, causing severe gastrointestinal upset (important to distinguish from edible relatives).

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Major decomposers of wood, contributing substantially to nutrient cycling and forest regeneration.

- **Scientific and educational relevance:**
  - Often featured in mushroom field guides due to their bright colors and easily observed clustered fruiting habit.
  - Useful teaching examples for ecological succession and wood decay.

Their brilliant displays on dead wood and importance as decomposers make _Hypholoma_ a key genus in forest ecology and mycology education.
