## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Agrocybe praecox_  
* **Authority & year:** Fayod, 1889  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized brownish mushrooms, dry to slightly viscid caps, dark brown spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Agrocybe** was described by **Victor Fayod** in 1889. The name derives from Greek _agros_ ("field") and _cybe_ ("head"), indicating that many species occur in open, grassy, or disturbed areas like fields and gardens.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Agrocybe** species are classic examples of "field mushrooms" in their growth and appearance:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly flat, dry to slightly sticky, often tan, ochre, brownish, or yellowish.
  - Gills are adnate to adnexed, pale at first, darkening to brown as spores mature.
  - Stipes are central, smooth to fibrous, often robust, occasionally with a faint ring.
  - Spore prints are dark brown to sooty brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, brown, ellipsoid to almond-shaped.
  - Cheilocystidia are often abundant and morphologically diverse.

**Synapomorphies** include dry or slightly sticky brown caps, dark brown spore prints, and saprotrophic lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Agrocybe** within the Strophariaceae, although it shows ecological and morphological similarities to genera in Agaricaceae (such as _Agaricus_).

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Strophariaceae
 ├── Stropharia
 ├── Hypholoma
 ├── Agrocybe
 └── Pholiota
```
The genus likely diversified in open landscapes during the spread of grasslands and agricultural habitats.

Important species include:

- _Agrocybe praecox_ (spring fieldcap)
- _Agrocybe pediades_ (common fieldcap)
- _Agrocybe aegerita_ (pioppino mushroom)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, fields, roadsides, gardens, forest edges, disturbed soils, wood chips.
- **Substrates:** Soil, compost, mulch, decomposing herbaceous debris, dead wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down plant material and enriching soils.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found widely across temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions.

Species often appear after rains, particularly during spring and early summer.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Agrocybe** fungi have moderate culinary and ecological importance:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Agrocybe aegerita_ (pioppino) is widely cultivated and prized for its rich, nutty flavor.
  - Other species like _A. praecox_ are sometimes eaten but have a reputation for variable quality and must be carefully identified.

- **Cultivation:**
  - _Agrocybe aegerita_ is cultivated on hardwood logs and artificial substrates, especially in Italy, China, and Japan.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Rapid decomposers of dead plant material, contributing to nutrient recycling and soil health.

- **Cautionary notes:**
  - Accurate identification is important, as some brown mushrooms in disturbed soils could resemble mildly toxic species.

Their role as recyclers in fields and gardens and their culinary contributions make _Agrocybe_ an important genus in both natural and agricultural ecosystems.
