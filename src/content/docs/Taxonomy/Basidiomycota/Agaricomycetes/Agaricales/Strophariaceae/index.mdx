# Strophariaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Strophariaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Stropharia aeruginosa_ (for the type genus _Stropharia_)  
* **Authority & year:** Singer, 1951  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized mushrooms, purple-brown to dark brown spore prints, saprotrophic, often viscid caps  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Strophariaceae** was formally established by **Rolf Singer** in 1951 to group together purple- to dark-brown spored agarics sharing saprotrophic habits and morphological traits such as thick-walled spores and chrysocystidia (specialized cystidia with refractive contents).

The name is based on the type genus _Stropharia_, derived from Greek _strophos_ ("belt" or "twist"), likely referring to the partial veil remnants forming a ring around the stipe.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Strophariaceae** fungi are often colorful, sturdy mushrooms found on nutrient-rich substrates:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly umbonate, often sticky or viscid when moist.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to adnexed), often darkening to purplish or blackish as spores mature.
  - Stipes are central, usually with a membranous annulus (ring).
  - Spore prints are purple-brown to dark brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, dark, ellipsoid to almond-shaped, often with a germ pore.
  - Chrysocystidia (large refractive cystidia) are frequently present and important for identification.

**Synapomorphies** include dark spore prints, presence of chrysocystidia, and saprotrophic ecology.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Strophariaceae** as a coherent family within Agaricales, related to Hymenogastraceae and Psathyrellaceae.

Major genera include:

- _Stropharia_ (core genus)
- _Hypholoma_ (clustered wood decomposers)
- _Pholiota_ (scaly-capped wood decomposers)
- _Psilocybe_ (some species still classified here historically, but most now placed in Hymenogastraceae)

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

Agaricales
 ├── Psathyrellaceae
 ├── Hymenogastraceae
 └── Strophariaceae
      ├── Stropharia
      ├── Hypholoma
      └── Pholiota
```
The family diversified rapidly during the Cenozoic with the spread of forests and grasslands, adapting to abundant plant debris.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Decaying wood, compost heaps, grasslands, forest floors, wood chips, disturbed soils.
- **Substrates:** Dead logs, fallen leaves, bark mulch, grassy soils.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic plant material.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; species found in temperate, tropical, and boreal regions worldwide.

Species often fruit prolifically after heavy rains and in human-altered environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Strophariaceae** fungi have notable ecological and some culinary significance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some _Stropharia_ and _Pholiota_ species are edible when young (e.g., _Stropharia rugosoannulata_, the wine-cap mushroom).
  - Other species (_Hypholoma fasciculare_, the sulfur tuft) are bitter or mildly toxic.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important recyclers of dead wood and plant debris, supporting soil health and forest regeneration.

- **Scientific and cultural relevance:**
  - Some _Psilocybe_ species, formerly placed here, contributed significantly to early research into hallucinogenic mushrooms and psychedelic therapy.
  - _Stropharia_ species are commonly included in mushroom cultivation experiments for their rapid growth and biomass recycling potential.

Their colorful fruitbodies, saprotrophic power, and historical ties to fungal systematics make Strophariaceae one of the most interesting families of dark-spored agarics.
