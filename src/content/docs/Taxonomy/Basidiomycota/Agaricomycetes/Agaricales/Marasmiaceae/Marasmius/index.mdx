## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Marasmius rotula_  
* **Authority & year:** (Scopoli) Gray, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small tough-stemmed mushrooms, convex or parachute-shaped caps, white to pale spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Marasmius** was formally established by **Samuel Frederick Gray** in 1821, building upon the early work of **Giovanni Antonio Scopoli**. The name comes from the Greek _marasmos_ ("withering" or "shriveling"), describing the mushrooms' ability to dry out and later revive with moisture — a remarkable ecological adaptation.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Marasmius** species are easy to recognize by a set of distinctive traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are small to tiny, often with parachute-shaped or convex caps.
  - Stipes are long, wiry, tough, and resistant to tearing, even when dry.
  - Gills are well spaced, adnexed to free, often white or cream-colored.
  - Spore prints are white to very pale pinkish.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and mostly ellipsoid or pip-shaped.
  - Cheilocystidia are often prominent and critical for species-level identification.

**Synapomorphies** include wiry stipes, drought resilience, white spore prints, and small saprotrophic basidiocarps.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Marasmius** within Marasmiaceae, along with close relatives like _Marasmiellus_ and _Mycetinis_.

The genus diversified extensively during the Cenozoic, adapting to forest floor litter decomposition across the globe.

Important species include:

- _Marasmius rotula_ (pinwheel mushroom)
- _Marasmius oreades_ (fairy ring mushroom)
- _Marasmius siccus_ (orange pinwheel)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Leaf litter, woody debris, mossy logs, forest floors, grassy meadows, and tropical rainforests.
- **Substrates:** Decaying leaves, fallen twigs, dead wood, forest duff, and organic debris.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, crucial for breaking down plant material and recycling nutrients.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found across temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions.

Species often fruit prolifically after rains, especially during warm, humid seasons.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Marasmius** fungi are important ecologically and culturally:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Marasmius oreades_ (fairy ring mushroom) is a highly regarded edible with a sweet, nutty flavor and pleasant chewy texture.
  - Other _Marasmius_ species are either too small or insubstantial for culinary use.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Major decomposers of leaf litter and forest debris, promoting nutrient turnover and soil health.
  - Their resilience to drying allows them to persist through drought periods and rebound quickly after rains.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - _Marasmius oreades_ is famous for forming fairy rings, which are steeped in folklore and myth about magical circles and dancing fairies.

Their small size belies their tremendous ecological importance, making _Marasmius_ a foundational genus in healthy ecosystems worldwide.
