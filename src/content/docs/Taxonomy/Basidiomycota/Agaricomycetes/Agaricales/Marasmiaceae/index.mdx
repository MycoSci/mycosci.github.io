# Marasmiaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Marasmiaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Marasmius rotula_ (for the type genus _Marasmius_)  
* **Authority & year:** Roze, 1876  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized mushrooms, tough or wiry stipes, white to pink spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Marasmiaceae** was formally described by **Ernest Roze** in 1876, primarily to accommodate small mushrooms like _Marasmius_ that shared tough, wiry stems and a tendency to revive after drying. The name is based on _Marasmius_, from the Greek _marasmos_ ("withering" or "shriveling"), referring to their ability to dehydrate and then rehydrate without major damage.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Marasmiaceae** fungi are unified by their characteristic toughness and ecological habits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are typically small to medium, often convex, with dry to slightly moist surfaces.
  - Stipes are thin, wiry, and very tough, often persisting long after the cap decays.
  - Gills are often widely spaced (distant) and attached or free.
  - Spore prints are usually white, pale pinkish, or very light.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline (colorless), and ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia are variable and important for species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include wiry, flexible stipes, white spore prints, and saprotrophic lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) confirm **Marasmiaceae** as a distinct family within Agaricales, closely related to families like _Physalacriaceae_.

Major genera within Marasmiaceae include:

- _Marasmius_ (core genus)
- _Marasmiellus_
- _Mycetinis_ (garlic-scented mushrooms)
- _Crinipellis_
- _Gloiocephala_

The family diversified mainly during the Cenozoic, exploiting fallen leaf litter and woody debris in a wide variety of ecosystems.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, grasslands, tropical rainforests, temperate woodlands, mossy banks.
- **Substrates:** Leaf litter, dead wood, herbaceous stems, moss, and soil.
- **Trophic modes:** Primarily saprotrophic, decomposing organic matter efficiently.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; species are common from tropical to temperate ecosystems worldwide.

Many species are vital decomposers in litter-rich environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Marasmiaceae** fungi have important ecological and limited culinary roles:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Marasmius oreades_, the fairy ring mushroom) are edible and valued for their chewy texture and nutty flavor.
  - Others are too small or tough to be worthwhile as food.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Major contributors to leaf litter decomposition.
  - Their ability to withstand drying and rehydrate gives them a competitive advantage in seasonally dry environments.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - _Marasmius oreades_ is famous for forming fairy rings, which have inspired folklore and myths about supernatural activities.

Their toughness, resilience, and ecological roles make Marasmiaceae fungi foundational members of healthy soil ecosystems.
