# Crepidotaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Crepidotaceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Crepidotus mollis_ (for the type genus _Crepidotus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Singer, 1948  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Sessile (stemless) or lateral-stemmed mushrooms, brown spore prints, saprotrophic, wood and plant debris decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Crepidotaceae** was formally described by **Rolf Singer** in 1948. It is named after the type genus _Crepidotus_, meaning "little sandal" or "slipper" in Greek, referring to the characteristic shape of the fruiting bodies that often attach laterally to substrates without a central stalk. Molecular studies have since confirmed Crepidotaceae as a distinct lineage within the Agaricales.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Crepidotaceae** fungi share a set of unifying features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are often sessile (without a true stipe) or have a lateral, reduced stem.
  - Caps are typically kidney-shaped, fan-shaped, or shell-like.
  - Gills are crowded and attached, usually descending slightly onto the substrate.
  - Spore prints are cinnamon-brown to rusty-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped and typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth to slightly ornamented, ellipsoid to broadly oval, often with warty surfaces.
  - Cheilocystidia are abundant and often diagnostic at the species level.

**Synapomorphies** include the sessile growth habit, brown spore prints, and smooth to warty brown spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Crepidotaceae** solidly within Agaricales, distinct from related brown-spored groups like _Cortinariaceae_ and _Strophariaceae_.

Major genera within Crepidotaceae include:

- _Crepidotus_ (largest genus)
- _Pleuroflammula_
- _Melanotus_
- _Simocybe_

The family likely diversified with the spread of decaying wood and plant debris in forest ecosystems during the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Decaying wood, bark, dead herbaceous stems, forest litter, and occasionally living plant surfaces.
- **Substrates:** Dead wood, decaying leaves, branches, grass stems, mossy logs.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing plant debris and contributing to nutrient cycling.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across tropical, temperate, and boreal ecosystems.

Many species are common after rains, especially on fallen wood and debris.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Crepidotaceae** fungi are important ecologically but are little known culturally:

- **Edibility:**
  - Most species are considered inedible, either due to small size, tough texture, or lack of known culinary value.
  - Some species have unknown edibility and should be avoided.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Play vital roles as wood decomposers, particularly on fallen branches, twigs, and small debris.
  - Help break down lignocellulosic material, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Occasionally collected for scientific study, biodiversity surveys, and educational purposes.

Their modest size and unassuming appearance belie their crucial role in maintaining healthy forest ecosystems.
