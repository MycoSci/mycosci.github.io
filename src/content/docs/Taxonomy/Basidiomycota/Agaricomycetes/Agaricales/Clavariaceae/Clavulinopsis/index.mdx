## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Clavulinopsis corniculata_  
* **Authority & year:** Corner, 1950  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Coral-like or club-shaped basidiocarps, smooth surfaces, vibrant colors (yellow, orange, red), white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Clavulinopsis** was described by **E. J. H. Corner** in 1950 as part of his monumental work on coral fungi. The name means "resembling _Clavulina_," reflecting similarities to that genus but distinguishing features such as smooth, non-septate basidia and differences in branching patterns. _Clavulinopsis_ is notable for its brightly colored, delicate coral fungi.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Clavulinopsis** species are easy to spot among grassland fungi thanks to their vivid colors:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are upright, simple clubs or branched corals.
  - Surfaces are smooth (never spiny or roughened).
  - Colors range from bright yellow, orange, red, to white or pale pink.
  - Flesh is soft, brittle, and easily broken.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored, non-septate.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid or cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are usually absent.

**Synapomorphies** include coral-like growth, bright coloration, smooth hyaline spores, and soft brittle texture.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Clavulinopsis** firmly within Clavariaceae, separated from closely related genera like _Clavaria_ and _Ramariopsis_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Clavariaceae
 ├── Clavaria
 ├── Clavulinopsis
 ├── Ramariopsis
 └── Hirticlavula
```
_Clavulinopsis_ likely radiated alongside ancient grassland and heath ecosystems during the Cenozoic.

Important species include:

- _Clavulinopsis fusiformis_ (golden spindles)
- _Clavulinopsis sulcata_
- _Clavulinopsis corniculata_ (crested coral)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, pastures, lawns, heathlands, and lightly forested areas.
- **Substrates:** Soil, moss, decomposing plant matter.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing dead organic material.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found globally, especially in temperate and tropical climates.

Many species are indicators of ancient, low-nutrient grasslands or well-preserved semi-natural habitats.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Clavulinopsis** fungi are important for biodiversity and conservation:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Clavulinopsis fusiformis_) are edible but generally considered of modest culinary value.
  - Their small size and brittleness make them less significant for foraging.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Serve as indicators of healthy, unimproved grasslands.
  - Contribute to soil nutrient cycling and biodiversity.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Sensitive to habitat destruction and nutrient enrichment (e.g., fertilizer use).
  - Featured in conservation assessments for grassland fungal communities.

Their vivid colors and fragile forms make _Clavulinopsis_ a favorite among mushroom photographers and conservationists alike.
