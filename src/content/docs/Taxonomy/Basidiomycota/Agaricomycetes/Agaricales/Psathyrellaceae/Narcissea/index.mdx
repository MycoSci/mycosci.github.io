# Narcissea <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Psathyrellaceae › **Genus:** Narcissea

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Narcissea patouillardii_  
* **Authority & year:** D. Wächter & A. Melzer, 2020  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small fragile mushrooms, white to pale brown caps, dark brown spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Narcissea** was established by **Dominik Wächter** and **Andreas Melzer** in 2020 following a major molecular reclassification of the Psathyrellaceae. The name honors **Narcisse Théophile Patouillard**, a pioneering French mycologist who made significant contributions to fungal taxonomy.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Narcissea** species resemble other fragile Psathyrellaceae members but have distinct molecular signatures:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are small, delicate, conical to bell-shaped, often hygrophanous (changing color with moisture).
  - Colors range from whitish to pale tan or light brown.
  - Gills are free to adnate, starting pale and darkening as spores mature.
  - Stipes are slender, fragile, often smooth and pale.
  - Spore prints are dark brown to black.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, ellipsoid, dark brown, with a germ pore.
  - Cheilocystidia are present and structurally variable, important for species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include delicate habit, dark spores, saprotrophic lifestyle, and specific molecular markers separating them from _Psathyrella_.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) position **Narcissea** within Psathyrellaceae as a monophyletic group distinct from _Psathyrella_, _Coprinellus_, and _Coprinopsis_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Psathyrellaceae
 ├── Psathyrella
 ├── Coprinellus
 ├── Coprinopsis
 ├── Narcissea
 └── Britzelmayria
```
The genus likely diversified alongside temperate and subtropical forest ecosystems, occupying niches in leaf litter and rich organic soils.

Key species include:

- _Narcissea patouillardii_ (type species)
- _Narcissea miniata_
- _Narcissea flavescens_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Leaf litter, mossy soils, decomposing herbaceous material, sometimes on wood debris.
- **Substrates:** Decaying plant matter, moist soils rich in organic material.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic debris rapidly.

- **Geographic range:** Mainly described from Europe and North America, with broader distribution likely underdocumented.

Species typically fruit during rainy seasons, often forming scattered groups on forest floors.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Narcissea** fungi are primarily ecologically important:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not considered edible due to small size, fragility, and lack of culinary interest.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Contribute significantly to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems by breaking down leaf litter and small debris.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for understanding cryptic fungal diversity revealed by molecular phylogenetics.
  - Their separation from _Psathyrella_ highlights advances in fungal taxonomy.

Their delicate forms and ecological roles make _Narcissea_ a subtle but vital component of forest fungal communities.
