## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Britzelmayria melleiceps_  
* **Authority & year:** D. Wächter & A. Melzer, 2020  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium fragile mushrooms, pale to honey-colored caps, dark brown spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Britzelmayria** was established by **Dominik Wächter** and **Andreas Melzer** in 2020, based on molecular evidence separating it from _Psathyrella_. It honors **Max Britzelmayr**, a German mycologist known for his contributions to European fungal taxonomy.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Britzelmayria** species resemble typical small saprotrophic mushrooms but have defining genetic and subtle morphological traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are small to medium-sized, convex to bell-shaped, often honey-colored or pale brown.
  - Surfaces are smooth to slightly fibrillose (fibrous) and hygrophanous (changing color as they dry).
  - Gills are adnate to free, initially pale, darkening to brownish as spores mature.
  - Stipes are slender, fragile, and often whitish to pale brown.
  - Spore prints are dark brown to blackish.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, brown, ellipsoid to ovoid.
  - Cheilocystidia are abundant and variable, key for species-level identification.

**Synapomorphies** include fragile fruitbodies, dark spore prints, and saprotrophic habits, combined with distinctive DNA profiles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) position **Britzelmayria** firmly within Psathyrellaceae, distinct from _Psathyrella_ and _Coprinellus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Psathyrellaceae
 ├── Psathyrella
 ├── Coprinellus
 ├── Coprinopsis
 ├── Britzelmayria
 └── Parasola
```
The genus likely diversified alongside the expansion of temperate and subtropical grasslands and forest litter ecosystems.

Key species:

- _Britzelmayria melleiceps_ (honey-headed Britzelmayria)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Leaf litter, mossy ground, forest soils, grasslands, and disturbed areas.
- **Substrates:** Decomposing organic matter such as dead leaves, small twigs, herbaceous debris.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, aiding in the breakdown of forest floor debris.

- **Geographic range:** Europe is best documented, but species are likely present in temperate regions worldwide.

Species often fruit after rains in late summer and autumn, sometimes appearing in large numbers.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Britzelmayria** fungi are primarily important for ecological roles rather than culinary or economic uses:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not considered edible; too small, fragile, and obscure for culinary interest.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important in decomposition and nutrient cycling in forest and meadow ecosystems.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Exemplifies how molecular phylogenetics continues to refine fungal taxonomy, separating cryptic lineages once lumped together morphologically.

Their subtlety and fragility hide their ecological importance in maintaining healthy soils and forest floor dynamics.
