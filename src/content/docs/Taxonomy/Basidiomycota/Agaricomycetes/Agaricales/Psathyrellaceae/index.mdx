# Psathyrellaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Psathyrellaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Psathyrella gracilis_ (for the type genus _Psathyrella_)  
* **Authority & year:** Vilgalys, Hopple & Jacq. Johnson, 2001  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized fragile mushrooms, dark brown to black spore prints, deliquescent (inky) or brittle flesh, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Psathyrellaceae** was established through the work of **Rytas Vilgalys**, **John Hopple**, and **Jacqueline Johnson** in 2001, based on molecular evidence. The name stems from _Psathyrella_ ("friable" or "fragile"), reflecting the delicate, brittle texture of many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Psathyrellaceae** fungi are recognized by their fragility and dark spores:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are typically thin, fragile, often hygrophanous (changing color when drying).
  - Colors range from white, tan, brown, to blackish, often dull in appearance.
  - Gills are attached (adnexed to free) and darken significantly as spores mature.
  - Stipes are slender and fragile, often hollow.
  - Spore prints are dark brown to black.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth to slightly roughened, dark-colored, often with a germ pore.
  - Cystidia are often abundant and crucial for species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include dark spore prints, fragile basidiocarps, and often inky deliquescence or brittle textures.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Psathyrellaceae** as a major, distinct family within Agaricales, separated from Coprinaceae sensu lato (older groupings).

Major genera include:

- _Psathyrella_ (type genus)
- _Coprinellus_ (small inky caps)
- _Coprinopsis_ (large inky caps)
- _Parasola_ (delicate, non-deliquescent inky caps)
- _Cystoagaricus_ and others

The family likely diversified rapidly in terrestrial ecosystems during the Cenozoic, specializing in the decomposition of herbaceous debris and dung.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, forests, dung heaps, compost, decaying wood, leaf litter.
- **Substrates:** Organic-rich soils, dung, dead wood, leaf litter, and herbaceous material.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic debris rapidly.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; species occur worldwide, often fruiting after rains.

Many species are pioneer decomposers, appearing early in ecological succession.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Psathyrellaceae** fungi are ecologically important but have limited direct economic use:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Coprinellus micaceus_) are edible when young but must be eaten promptly due to rapid decay.
  - Other species are fragile, too small, or toxic (_e.g., some _Coprinopsis_ species interact dangerously with alcohol_).

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Play key roles in the rapid decomposition of organic matter, returning nutrients to the soil.
  - Some _Coprinopsis_ species specialize in dung decomposition (coprophilous lifestyle).

- **Scientific interest:**
  - Deliquescence (self-digesting gills) observed in _Coprinellus_ and _Coprinopsis_ is a fascinating evolutionary adaptation for spore dispersal.

Their delicate structures and rapid life cycles make Psathyrellaceae a fascinating and essential component of ecosystem nutrient dynamics.
