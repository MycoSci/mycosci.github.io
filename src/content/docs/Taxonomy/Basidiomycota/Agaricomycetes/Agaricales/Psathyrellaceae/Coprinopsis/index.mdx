**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Psathyrellaceae › **Genus:** Coprinopsis

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Coprinopsis atramentaria_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fr.) P. Karsten, 1881  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** True inky caps, deliquescent gills, black spore prints, fragile mushrooms, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Coprinopsis** was originally segregated from _Coprinus_ by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1881, and its standing was confirmed through molecular phylogenetics (Vilgalys et al., 2001). The name _Coprinopsis_ means "resembling _Coprinus_," reflecting the typical inky cap appearance but based on distinct evolutionary lineage.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Coprinopsis** species are classic "true inkcaps," characterized by self-digesting gills:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are initially bell-shaped, becoming expanded or collapsing as the gills liquefy.
  - Cap surfaces can be smooth, hairy, scaly, or adorned with veil remnants.
  - Gills are free or narrowly attached, turning black and deliquescing (self-digesting into ink) with age.
  - Stipes are hollow, fragile, and often whitish.
  - Spore prints are black.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, dark brown to black, ellipsoid to almond-shaped, with a prominent germ pore.
  - Cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia vary widely and are useful for species differentiation.

**Synapomorphies** include deliquescent gills, dark spore prints, and fragile, rapidly decaying fruitbodies.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Coprinopsis** within Psathyrellaceae, separate from _Coprinellus_ (less strongly deliquescent) and _Parasola_ (non-deliquescent).

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Psathyrellaceae
 ├── Psathyrella
 ├── Coprinellus
 ├── Coprinopsis
 ├── Parasola
 └── Britzelmayria
```
The genus likely evolved to specialize in rapid colonization of nutrient-rich and disturbed environments.

Important species include:

- _Coprinopsis atramentaria_ (common inkcap)
- _Coprinopsis cinerea_ (gray shag)
- _Coprinopsis lagopus_ (harefoot inkcap)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Rich soils, compost heaps, dung, lawns, forest edges, disturbed grounds.
- **Substrates:** Decomposing plant debris, dung, decaying wood, organic-rich soil.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down organic material quickly.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widely distributed from temperate to tropical regions.

Species often appear overnight after rain, fruiting prolifically in favorable conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Coprinopsis** fungi have ecological and some historical culinary relevance:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Coprinopsis atramentaria_ is edible when young but **dangerous if consumed with alcohol** due to coprine, a toxin causing disulfiram-like reactions (flushing, nausea, vomiting).
  - Other species are too fragile or small for culinary use.

- **Historical significance:**
  - The black inky fluid produced by deliquescing gills was reportedly once used for writing ink.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Rapid decomposers of organic debris, crucial in nutrient cycling and early-stage soil recovery.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - _Coprinopsis cinerea_ is a model organism in fungal genetics and development research, with a fully sequenced genome.

Their fleeting, dramatic appearances and ecological role make _Coprinopsis_ a fascinating genus to study and observe.
