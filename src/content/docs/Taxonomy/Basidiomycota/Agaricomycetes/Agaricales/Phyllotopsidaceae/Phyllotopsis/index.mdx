## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Phyllotopsis nidulans_  
* **Authority & year:** (Persoon) Singer, 1947  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Brightly colored fan- or oyster-shaped mushrooms, decurrent gills, strong unpleasant odors, white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Phyllotopsis** was established by **Rolf Singer** in 1947, based on earlier descriptions by **Christiaan Hendrik Persoon**. The name combines Greek _phyllon_ ("leaf") and _opsis_ ("appearance"), referring to the leaf-like arrangement of the gills on these laterally attached, fan-shaped mushrooms.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Phyllotopsis** species are striking but often off-putting due to their smell:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are fan- to oyster-shaped, often brightly colored (orange, yellow, or salmon-pink).
  - Surfaces can be dry, finely hairy, or slightly velvety.
  - Gills are decurrent (running down the stipe or point of attachment), close, and pale orange to cream.
  - Stipes are absent or very rudimentary, with lateral attachment to wood.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are commonly present.

**Synapomorphies** include fan-shaped brightly colored fruitbodies, unpleasant odors, and white spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Phyllotopsis** securely within Phyllotopsidaceae, separated from other fan-shaped or oyster-like fungi such as _Pleurotus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Phyllotopsidaceae
 ├── Phyllotopsis
 └── Contumyces
```
The genus likely evolved to specialize in rapid decomposition of moist, decaying wood in temperate forests.

Important species include:

- _Phyllotopsis nidulans_ (mock oyster)
- _Phyllotopsis magnoliae_
- _Phyllotopsis subnidulans_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist, shaded forests; especially found on fallen logs, stumps, and decaying hardwood.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead wood (hardwoods and occasionally conifers).
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing lignified plant material.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed in temperate zones across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia.

Fruiting occurs mainly in cooler seasons (autumn and winter), often in dense, layered groups.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Phyllotopsis** fungi are visually distinctive but not edible:

- **Edibility:**
  - Generally considered **inedible** or unpalatable due to tough flesh and strong unpleasant odors (often likened to rotting cabbage or dirty socks).

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers of forest wood, facilitating nutrient cycling and soil enrichment.
  - Contribute to forest structure by breaking down fallen logs and dead standing trees.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Their vivid colors and "mock oyster" appearance often lead to misidentification by amateur mushroom hunters.
  - Appreciated in photography and field guides for their bright aesthetic, despite the odor.

Despite their lack of culinary appeal, _Phyllotopsis_ mushrooms are essential players in woodland ecosystems.
