# Lyophyllaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Lyophyllaceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lyophyllum decastes_ (for the type genus _Lyophyllum_)  
* **Authority & year:** Kühner, 1938  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized gilled mushrooms, often growing in clusters, white to gray spore prints, mostly saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Lyophyllaceae** was established by **Robert Kühner** in 1938 to accommodate a group of robust, often clustered gilled mushrooms. The name derives from the type genus _Lyophyllum_, which means "loose leaves" (from Greek _lyo-_ "loosen" and _phyllon_ "leaf"), describing the somewhat flexible and attached gills.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lyophyllaceae** species are unified by certain macroscopic and microscopic traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are fleshy, smooth to slightly scaly, and often gray, brownish, or whitish.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to adnexed), crowded, often white to grayish, and can darken with age.
  - Stipes are usually stout and tough.
  - Spore prints are white to pale gray.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid, hyaline (colorless).
  - Clamp connections are common at hyphal septa.

**Synapomorphies** include fleshy, often clustered basidiocarps, white spore prints, and smooth hyaline spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) support **Lyophyllaceae** as a distinct lineage within Agaricales, although some genera traditionally placed here have been reassigned based on DNA evidence.

Major genera within Lyophyllaceae include:

- _Lyophyllum_ (type genus)
- _Tephrocybe_
- _Calocybe_
- _Myochromella_

      ├── Tephrocybe
      └── Myochromella
```
The family diversified during the Cenozoic, exploiting grassland, forest, and disturbed ecosystems.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, woodlands, forest edges, disturbed soils, and meadows.
- **Substrates:** Soil, leaf litter, wood debris, and occasionally dung-enriched soils.
- **Trophic modes:** Primarily saprotrophic; some species are weakly mycorrhizal.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found worldwide in temperate, tropical, and boreal regions.

Species often fruit in clusters, forming fairy rings or dense troops after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lyophyllaceae** fungi have moderate ecological and culinary significance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_Lyophyllum decastes_, _Calocybe gambosa_) are edible and valued regionally.
  - Others are tough, bland, or poorly studied for edibility.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers in grassland and forest ecosystems.
  - Play a role in soil nutrient cycling and organic matter breakdown.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - _Calocybe gambosa_ ("St. George’s mushroom") is prized in parts of Europe for its early spring fruiting and sweet flavor.

Due to their robust forms and frequent clustering, Lyophyllaceae species are often noticeable and important elements of the fungal landscape.
