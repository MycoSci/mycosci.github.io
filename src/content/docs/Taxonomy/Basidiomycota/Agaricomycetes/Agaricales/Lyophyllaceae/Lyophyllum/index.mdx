## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lyophyllum decastes_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) Kühner, 1938  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium to large mushrooms, grayish to brownish caps, clustered growth habit, white spore prints, saprotrophic or mycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Lyophyllum** was established by **Robert Kühner** in 1938, building upon earlier descriptions by **Elias Magnus Fries**. The name derives from the Greek _lyo-_ ("loose") and _phyllon_ ("leaf" or "gill"), referring to the loosely spaced gills in some species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lyophyllum** species have a distinct suite of field and microscopic traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are fleshy, smooth to finely scaly, often gray, brownish, or grayish-white.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to adnexed), crowded to slightly distant, typically pale at first, darkening slightly with age.
  - Stipes are firm, smooth, often thick, and without a true ring.
  - Fruiting bodies often grow in tight clusters or dense troops.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are common throughout the hyphae.

**Synapomorphies** include clustered fruiting habits, white spore prints, and smooth, hyaline spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Lyophyllum** within the Lyophyllaceae, closely related to genera like _Calocybe_ and _Tephrocybe_.

_Lyophyllum_ species likely diversified in temperate and boreal ecosystems, favoring forest soils and disturbed ground.

Key species include:

- _Lyophyllum decastes_ (fried chicken mushroom)
- _Lyophyllum connatum_ (white domecap)
- _Lyophyllum shimeji_ (cultivated in Japan)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, woodlands, roadsides, forest edges, and disturbed soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in organic matter, often near decaying wood or leaf litter.
- **Trophic modes:** Primarily saprotrophic, although some species form ectomycorrhizal associations with trees.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found widely in temperate zones across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia.

Many species are common in late summer to autumn, especially following rainfall.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lyophyllum** fungi are important both ecologically and gastronomically:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Lyophyllum decastes_ is considered a good edible species when properly identified, although caution is advised due to confusion with toxic look-alikes (e.g., _Entoloma_ species).
  - _Lyophyllum shimeji_ is commercially cultivated and highly prized in Japanese cuisine for its firm texture and umami flavor.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important decomposers of plant litter and wood debris.
  - Enhance soil structure and contribute to nutrient cycling in grassland and forest ecosystems.

- **Cautionary notes:**
  - Proper identification is critical when collecting _Lyophyllum_ species for food, as toxic species from other genera can look superficially similar.

Their robust, clustered growth habit and role in forest and grassland health make _Lyophyllum_ an important genus for ecologists, foragers, and mycologists.
