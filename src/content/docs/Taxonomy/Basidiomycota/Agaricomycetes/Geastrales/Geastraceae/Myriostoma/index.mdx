## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Myriostoma coliforme_  
* **Authority & year:** Desv., 1809  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Earthstar fungi, multiple ostioles (spore openings) on central spore sac, tough peridium, ornamented brown spores, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Myriostoma** was first described by **Nicaise Auguste Desvaux** in 1809. The name comes from Greek _myrios_ ("countless") and _stoma_ ("mouth"), referring to the multiple pores (ostioles) through which spores are released — unlike _Geastrum_, which has only one.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Myriostoma** species are some of the most distinctive among gasteroid fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are initially globose, later splitting into multiple thick, leathery rays (earthstar form).
  - The central spore sac (endoperidium) sits atop the rays and has multiple small openings (ostioles) for spore dispersal.
  - Colors are typically grayish to brownish.
  - Rays may lift the spore sac above the ground surface for efficient spore dispersal.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are thick-walled, brown, ornamented (warted or spiny).
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include multiple ostioles, leathery rays, and ornamented brown spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Myriostoma** as a close relative of _Geastrum_ within Geastraceae but distinct due to its multiple-spore-exit morphology.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Geastraceae
 ├── Geastrum
 └── Myriostoma
```
The genus likely evolved as a specialized form to maximize spore dispersal under drier and more variable environmental conditions.

Important species include:

- _Myriostoma coliforme_ (the pepper pot earthstar)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dry, sandy soils, open woodlands, grasslands, and scrubby environments.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in decayed organic matter.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down leaf litter and organic debris.

- **Geographic range:** Widely scattered but rare; found in Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Australasia.

Species often fruit after rains but can persist for long periods due to their tough structure.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Myriostoma** fungi are ecologically valuable and culturally fascinating:

- **Edibility:**
  - Considered **inedible** due to toughness and lack of culinary qualities.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Play a role in soil nutrient recycling and stabilization in dry, open habitats.
  - Adapted for rain splash and wind-based spore dispersal.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Serve as a model for studying adaptations to dry ecosystems and dispersal biology among fungi.

Their rarity, bizarre beauty, and evolutionary significance make _Myriostoma_ a fascinating and much-admired genus among earthstars.
