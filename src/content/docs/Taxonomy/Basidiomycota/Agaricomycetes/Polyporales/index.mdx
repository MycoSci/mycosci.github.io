# Polyporales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Polyporus squamosus_ (for the type genus _Polyporus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Gäumann, 1926  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Bracket fungi, poroid undersurfaces, tough to woody fruitbodies, white rot and brown rot agents, saprotrophic or parasitic  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Polyporales** was established by **Ernst Gäumann** in 1926. It is named after the type genus _Polyporus_, which comes from Greek _poly-_ ("many") and _poros_ ("pores"), referring to the many small pores on the underside of their fruiting bodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Polyporales** fungi are highly diverse but share key traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies range from crust-like to large bracket-shaped shelves.
  - Undersurfaces have pores rather than gills or spines.
  - Texture ranges from leathery and tough to corky and woody.
  - Colors are often brown, white, gray, orange, or yellow.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth to ornamented, hyaline or brownish.
  - Clamp connections are variably present or absent.

**Synapomorphies** include poroid hymenophores, wood decay capabilities (white rot or brown rot), and persistent fruitbodies.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb1, rpb2) reveal that **Polyporales** is a large, complex group comprising many formerly unrelated-looking fungi unified by DNA similarities.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricomycetes
 ├── Polyporales
 ├── Hymenochaetales
 └── Other orders
```
The order likely diversified with the rise of complex forest ecosystems, adapting to various wood decay strategies.

Major families include:

- _Polyporaceae_ (classic shelf fungi)
- _Fomitopsidaceae_ (brown rot polypores)
- _Ganodermataceae_ (including _Ganoderma_, the reishi mushrooms)
- _Meruliaceae_
- _Steccherinaceae_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests of all types, urban parks, garden mulch, fallen logs, standing dead trees.
- **Substrates:** Primarily wood (dead or living); some species occur on soil or herbaceous stems.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic (decomposing dead wood) or parasitic (attacking living trees).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; abundant in temperate, tropical, and boreal forests worldwide.

Species can fruit year-round depending on climate and conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Polyporales** fungi are essential for forests and humans:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species are edible (_e.g., Polyporus squamosus_ when young, _Laetiporus sulphureus_ - chicken of the woods).
  - Others (_e.g., Ganoderma spp._) are used medicinally.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major agents of wood decomposition, carbon cycling, and forest ecosystem regeneration.
  - Help create habitats for insects, birds, and small mammals by hollowing out trees.

- **Economic significance:**
  - Some species cause major economic losses in forestry by rotting valuable timber.
  - Others (_e.g., Ganoderma_) are cultivated for medicinal extracts worldwide.

Their astonishing forms, ecological service, and cultural uses make _Polyporales_ one of the most ecologically and economically important fungal orders.
