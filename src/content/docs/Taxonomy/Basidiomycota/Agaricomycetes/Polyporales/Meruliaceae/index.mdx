# Meruliaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Meruliaceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Merulius tremellosus_ (for the type genus _Merulius_)  
* **Authority & year:** Rea, 1922  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Crust-like to bracket fungi, wrinkled (merulioid) hymenophores, white rot agents, soft to tough textures  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Meruliaceae** was established by **Carleton Rea** in 1922. It is named after the genus _Merulius_, from Latin _merulus_ ("blackbird") — a historical name that shifted to fungi due to perceived textural similarities of their surfaces.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Meruliaceae** fungi are highly variable in form but share key traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are resupinate (crust-like), bracket-shaped, or semi-resupinate.
  - Hymenophores are smooth, wrinkled (merulioid), poroid, or even partly toothed.
  - Coloration is typically pale (whitish, buff) to yellow, pinkish, or brownish.
  - Texture ranges from soft and spongy when fresh to brittle or leathery when dry.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are often present.

**Synapomorphies** include highly variable hymenophore textures, white rot decay, and generally soft textures during active growth.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) support **Meruliaceae** as a major clade within Polyporales, distinct from traditional hard polypores like _Polyporaceae_ and brown rot fungi like _Fomitopsidaceae_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporales
 ├── Polyporaceae
 ├── Fomitopsidaceae
 └── Meruliaceae
```
The family represents an evolutionary radiation toward diverse wood decay forms adapted for different humidity and substrate types.

Major genera:

- _Merulius_ (historical type)
- _Phlebia_ (large, colorful crust fungi)
- _Bjerkandera_
- _Abortiporus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead wood in forests, fallen logs, stumps, and coarse woody debris.
- **Substrates:** Primarily hardwoods; some species on conifers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot (degrading lignin and cellulose).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; abundant in temperate, tropical, and boreal ecosystems.

Species are common following moist conditions and contribute heavily to forest decomposition.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Meruliaceae** fungi are ecologically critical and scientifically valuable:

- **Edibility:**
  - Most species are not consumed due to tough or insubstantial textures.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Efficient decomposers, critical for nutrient recycling and forest floor dynamics.
  - Some species (_e.g., Phlebia radiata_) are models for advanced lignin-degrading enzyme systems.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their oxidative enzymes (laccases, peroxidases) with potential applications in bioremediation and industrial biomass processing.

Their beautiful merulioid folds, versatile decay abilities, and biotechnological promise make _Meruliaceae_ one of the most important families of crust and bracket fungi.
