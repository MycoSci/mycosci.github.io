# Phlebia <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Meruliaceae › **Genus:** Phlebia

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Phlebia radiata_  
* **Authority & year:** Fr., 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Crust-like fungi, wrinkled (merulioid) hymenophores, brightly colored (pink, orange, yellow), white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Phlebia** was established by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1821. The name is derived from Greek _phlebos_ ("vein") — a reference to the wrinkled, veined appearance of the spore-bearing surfaces in many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Phlebia** species are elegant crust fungi with vivid colors:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are resupinate (crust-like), thin, spreading closely over substrates.
  - Hymenophores are smooth to wrinkled (merulioid), sometimes vein-like or slightly tuberculate.
  - Colors are typically bright — pink, salmon, orange, yellow, or pale cream.
  - Textures are soft to leathery when fresh, becoming brittle when dry.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are present.

**Synapomorphies** include bright coloration, wrinkled merulioid hymenophores, and saprotrophic white rot.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Phlebia** within the Meruliaceae family, related to genera like _Climacodon_ and _Merulius_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Meruliaceae
 ├── Phlebia
 ├── Climacodon
 └── Merulius
```
The genus likely diversified into different forest microhabitats specializing in early decomposition stages.

Important species include:

- _Phlebia radiata_ (radiating wrinkled crust)
- _Phlebia tremellosa_ (jelly-like Phlebia)
- _Phlebia incarnata_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Fallen logs, stumps, dead branches, and forest litter; primarily hardwood substrates but sometimes found on conifers.
- **Substrates:** Dead wood, bark, and sometimes mossy soil.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing efficient white rot decay of lignified material.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in temperate and tropical forests across the globe.

Species typically fruit during moist seasons but can persist into dry and cold periods.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Phlebia** fungi are ecologically important and increasingly scientifically valuable:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are thin and insubstantial.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Rapid decomposers of coarse woody debris, critical to nutrient recycling and forest regeneration.
  - Help facilitate the turnover of cellulose and lignin, making nutrients available to plants and other organisms.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - _Phlebia radiata_ is a model organism for lignin-degrading enzyme research.
  - Important in bioremediation studies for breaking down complex organic pollutants.

Their vibrant colors, silent ecological service, and emerging technological relevance make _Phlebia_ one of the most remarkable genera among crust fungi.
