**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Incrustoporiaceae › **Genus:** Tyromyces

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Tyromyces chioneus_  
* **Authority & year:** P. Karst., 1881  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Soft, fleshy polypores, white to pale-colored caps and pores, white rot fungi, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Tyromyces** was described by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1881. The name derives from Greek _tyros_ ("cheese") and _myces_ ("fungus"), likely referring to the soft, crumbly texture of fresh fruitbodies in many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Tyromyces** species are classic examples of soft polypores:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are shelf-like (bracket-shaped), soft, and fleshy when fresh, becoming brittle upon drying.
  - Upper surfaces are usually smooth, white, cream, or pale buff.
  - Pore surfaces are white to pale cream with small, round pores.
  - Caps may be velvety, hairy, or glabrous depending on species.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, thin-walled, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Cystidia are often absent or inconspicuous.
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include soft, pale-colored, quickly decaying fruitbodies and efficient white rot capabilities.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Tyromyces** within Incrustoporiaceae (Polyporales), though the genus has historically been treated in Polyporaceae. Recent studies support its placement near _Incrustoporia_ and other soft white-rot polypores.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

The genus represents an evolutionary strategy for rapid colonization and decomposition of recently fallen wood and logs.

Important species include:

- _Tyromyces chioneus_ (white cheese polypore)
- _Tyromyces fissilis_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Fallen logs, stumps, dead branches of both hardwood and softwood species.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot by degrading lignin and cellulose.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widely distributed across temperate forests worldwide.

Species are common after storms and forest disturbances when fresh deadwood is abundant.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Tyromyces** fungi are small but critical players in forest nutrient cycles:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not considered edible — fruitbodies are bland, soft, and quickly deteriorate.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Rapid decomposers of fresh deadwood, important for returning nutrients to forest soils.
  - Early colonizers that prepare wood for later successional fungal communities.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for insights into fungal succession on deadwood and white rot enzymatic pathways.

Their soft appearance, ephemeral fruiting, and ecological importance make _Tyromyces_ a quiet but vital genus among forest fungi.
