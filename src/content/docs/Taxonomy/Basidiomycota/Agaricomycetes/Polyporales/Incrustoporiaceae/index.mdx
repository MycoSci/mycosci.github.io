# Incrustoporiaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Incrustoporiaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Incrustoporia carneola_ (for the type genus _Incrustoporia_)  
* **Authority & year:** Jülich, 1981  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium poroid fungi, incrusted cystidia, soft to tough fruitbodies, white rot agents  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Incrustoporiaceae** was described by **Walter Jülich** in 1981 to accommodate a group of poroid fungi that produce cystidia with encrusted (resin-like) contents, a key microscopic feature. The name _Incrustoporia_ reflects this ("incrusted pores").

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Incrustoporiaceae** fungi are distinguished by microscopic features as much as by macroscopic form:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are crust-like to bracket-shaped, tough or leathery.
  - Hymenophores are poroid, with round to angular pores, white to cream when young, sometimes aging yellowish or brown.
  - Upper surfaces vary from smooth to slightly hairy.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Cystidia are common, thick-walled, and often encrusted with crystalline deposits (diagnostic feature).
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include the presence of encrusted cystidia, poroid hymenophores, and soft to tough textures supporting white rot decay.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) support **Incrustoporiaceae** as a distinct family within Polyporales, related but separate from families like _Polyporaceae_ and _Steccherinaceae_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporales
 ├── Polyporaceae
 ├── Steccherinaceae
 └── Incrustoporiaceae
```
The family likely represents a diversification into saprotrophic niches, favoring rapid colonization and wood decomposition.

Major genera:

- _Incrustoporia_ (type genus)
- _Sarcodontia_ (sometimes included depending on taxonomic treatments)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead wood (logs, branches, stumps) of both hardwood and coniferous trees.
- **Substrates:** Wood; occasionally on bark or exposed roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, primarily white rot decomposers.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across temperate and boreal forests worldwide.

Species tend to fruit abundantly after wet conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Incrustoporiaceae** fungi are important for forest nutrient recycling:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are too tough, small, and functionally suited for decomposition rather than culinary use.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key players in breaking down lignin-rich woody debris, contributing to soil formation and nutrient cycling.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for understanding wood decay diversity and the evolution of specialized cystidial structures among polypores.

Their microscopic beauty, ecological functionality, and specialization for forest decay make _Incrustoporiaceae_ a quietly important fungal family.
