# Grifola <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Grifolaceae › **Genus:** Grifola

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Grifola frondosa_  
* **Authority & year:** Gray, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Large, clustered polypores, rosette or leafy structures, white spore prints, white rot fungi, often parasitic on hardwoods  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Grifola** was formally described by **Samuel Frederick Gray** in 1821. The name likely refers to the "curly" or "fringed" appearance of the many fan-shaped caps forming a clustered rosette.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Grifola** species are some of the most impressive forest fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies form large, densely clustered masses composed of numerous overlapping fan- or spoon-shaped caps.
  - Upper surfaces are dry, gray, brown, or tan; margins are often wavy or lobed.
  - Undersurfaces have small, white to cream pores.
  - Flesh is firm, white, and fibrous.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include clustered rosette growth form, small round pores, and soft to firm textures supporting white rot wood decay.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb2) place **Grifola** within the Grifolaceae family of Polyporales, close to _Meripilus_ and other fleshy polypores.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Grifolaceae
 ├── Grifola
 └── Meripilus
```
The genus likely evolved adaptations for both parasitic and saprotrophic lifestyles on hardwoods.

Important species include:

- _Grifola frondosa_ (maitake or hen of the woods)
- _Grifola sordulenta_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Hardwood forests, particularly at the base of living oaks and other broadleaf trees.
- **Substrates:** Bases of living trees, stumps, and roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Weakly parasitic to saprotrophic, causing butt rot or root decay.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread across temperate zones of North America, Europe, and East Asia.

Species fruit prolifically in late summer and autumn, often reappearing at the same site for multiple years.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Grifola** fungi are famous for their culinary and medicinal value:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Grifola frondosa_ is a **choice edible mushroom**, highly valued for its firm texture and rich, nutty flavor.
  - Widely used in Asian, European, and North American cuisines.

- **Medicinal significance:**
  - _G. frondosa_ is extensively researched for polysaccharides with potential immune-boosting, anti-cancer, and cholesterol-lowering effects.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important decomposers and forest health indicators.
  - Play a role in nutrient cycling and canopy gap dynamics when they weaken old trees.

Their massive fruiting bodies, exceptional culinary and medicinal status, and fascinating ecological roles make _Grifola_ one of the most culturally and scientifically important fungal genera.
