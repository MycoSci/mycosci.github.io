# Cyanosporus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Polyporaceae › **Genus:** Cyanosporus

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Cyanosporus caeruleus_  
* **Authority & year:** Ryvarden, 1972  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Woody crust or bracket fungi, blue to bluish-gray spore prints, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Cyanosporus** was described by **Leif Ryvarden** in 1972 to accommodate polypores with a distinct blue spore print — a rare feature among fungi. The name derives from Greek _kyanos_ ("blue") and _sporos_ ("seed" or "spore").

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Cyanosporus** species are notable for their unique spore pigmentation:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are crust-like (resupinate) to bracket-shaped, tough and leathery.
  - Upper surfaces are smooth to slightly rough, colored brown, grayish, or dark.
  - Pore surfaces are small-pored, whitish to pale gray when young, sometimes becoming discolored with age.
  - Texture tough and woody.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, bluish to blue-gray in mass, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are often absent.

**Synapomorphies** include a tough fruitbody structure, white rot enzymatic decay, and distinctively bluish spore coloration.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Cyanosporus** within Polyporaceae, although its precise relationships with _Polyporus_ and related genera continue to be refined.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporaceae
 ├── Polyporus
 └── Cyanosporus
```
The genus likely represents a specialized lineage within white rot fungi, possibly adapted to unique ecological niches.

Important species:

- _Cyanosporus caeruleus_ (the blue-spored polypore)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Deadwood of hardwoods and occasionally conifers; often in shaded, moist forests.
- **Substrates:** Decaying logs, stumps, fallen branches.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily recorded from North America and Europe; may be under-recorded due to subtle morphology and overlooked coloration.

Species typically fruit during late summer to autumn, often persisting into winter.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Cyanosporus** fungi are a curiosity in the fungal world:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are too tough and woody.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key white rot decomposers, helping recycle wood into forest soils.
  - May harbor unique fungal enzymes of biotechnological interest due to their unusual pigmentation.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - The rare blue spore color invites research into fungal pigment biosynthesis and evolutionary significance.

Their understated appearance, strange spore coloration, and ecological roles make _Cyanosporus_ a small but fascinating genus within Polyporaceae.
