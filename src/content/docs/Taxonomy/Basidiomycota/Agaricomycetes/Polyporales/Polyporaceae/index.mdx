# Polyporaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Polyporaceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Polyporus squamosus_ (for the type genus _Polyporus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Corda, 1839  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Classic bracket fungi, poroid undersurfaces, woody or leathery fruitbodies, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Polyporaceae** was formally described by **August Carl Joseph Corda** in 1839 to encompass the classic shelf-like fungi with pores underneath. The name _Polyporaceae_ is derived from the Greek _poly-_ ("many") and _poros_ ("pores"), referencing the multiple pores through which spores are released.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Polyporaceae** fungi are the archetypal bracket or shelf fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are bracket-shaped, hoof-shaped, or sometimes crust-like.
  - Upper surfaces are smooth, velvety, rough, or zoned.
  - Hymenophores are poroid (pores rather than gills or spines).
  - Texture ranges from leathery to woody when mature.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are often present.

**Synapomorphies** include poroid hymenophores, white rot wood decay, and tough fruitbody structures adapted for prolonged spore dispersal.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) show that **Polyporaceae** forms a major group within Polyporales, distinct from brown rot families like _Fomitopsidaceae_ and more fleshy groups like _Grifolaceae_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporales
 ├── Fomitopsidaceae
 ├── Grifolaceae
 └── Polyporaceae
```
The family represents an adaptive radiation into numerous wood decay niches worldwide.

Major genera:

- _Polyporus_ (classic bracket fungi)
- _Lentinus_ (gilled polypores)
- _Datronia_
- _Neofavolus_
- _Trametes_ (sometimes included historically)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests of all types; fallen logs, standing dead trees, stumps.
- **Substrates:** Dead or dying hardwoods and softwoods.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic; occasionally weakly parasitic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; abundant in temperate, tropical, and boreal forests.

Species fruit year-round, often remaining visible even through harsh weather.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Polyporaceae** fungi are critical for forest health and human uses:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., young _Polyporus squamosus_) are edible when tender.
  - Many species are too tough for culinary purposes but are harvested for traditional medicine (_e.g.,_ _Lentinus_ spp.).

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key players in lignin and cellulose degradation.
  - Contribute to soil enrichment and habitat creation by decomposing coarse woody debris.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important models for studying wood rot, fungal life cycles, and biotechnological applications (e.g., biopulping, bioremediation).

Their classic forms, ecological ubiquity, and essential recycling roles make _Polyporaceae_ one of the most important and familiar fungal families in forests worldwide.
