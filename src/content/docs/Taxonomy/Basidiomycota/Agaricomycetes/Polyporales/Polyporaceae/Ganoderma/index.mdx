## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Ganoderma lucidum_  
* **Authority & year:** P. Karst., 1881  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Woody bracket fungi, varnished or dull caps, double-walled ornamented spores, white rot decomposers, medicinal use  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Ganoderma** was established by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1881. The name derives from Greek _ganos_ ("brightness, sheen") and _derma_ ("skin"), referring to the often shiny, varnished appearance of the fruitbody surface.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Ganoderma** fungi are known for their beauty and resilience:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are bracket-shaped or occasionally with a long stipe (stem).
  - Cap surfaces are shiny and varnished (in species like _G. lucidum_) or dull and rough (in species like _G. applanatum_).
  - Pore surfaces are white to brownish, bruising brown with age.
  - Flesh is fibrous to woody, typically brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are double-walled, ornamented with echinulate (spiny) or warty outer surfaces, brown in mass.
  - Clamp connections are usually absent.

**Synapomorphies** include ornamented double-walled spores, brown rot, tough persistent fruitbodies, and, in many species, a varnished surface.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb1, rpb2) show **Ganoderma** as a major lineage within Polyporaceae, but internal relationships are complex, and the genus may be polyphyletic (under revision).

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporaceae
 ├── Polyporus
 ├── Trametes
 ├── Fomes
 └── Ganoderma
```
The genus likely evolved multiple times to colonize both living trees and deadwood across diverse ecosystems.

Important species include:

- _Ganoderma lucidum_ (reishi or lingzhi)
- _Ganoderma applanatum_ (artist’s conk)
- _Ganoderma tsugae_ (hemlock varnish shelf)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Broadleaf and coniferous forests; urban parks and gardens.
- **Substrates:** Living trees, dead trunks, buried roots, stumps, and logs.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic and parasitic; causes white rot.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in temperate and tropical regions globally.

Species often fruit throughout the warm season and can persist for years.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Ganoderma** fungi are among the most culturally revered fungi:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not typically edible in the culinary sense — too tough.
  - Widely consumed medicinally as teas, extracts, powders, and supplements.

- **Medicinal significance:**
  - _Ganoderma lucidum_ (reishi or lingzhi) is one of the most famous medicinal mushrooms, used in traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean medicine.
  - Studied for bioactive compounds including triterpenes, polysaccharides, and antioxidants with potential immunomodulating, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and anti-aging effects.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important decomposers in forest ecosystems, accelerating the recycling of woody debris.
  - Play roles in weakening and hollowing old trees, creating habitat for wildlife.

Their shiny caps, legendary medicinal value, and crucial ecological roles make _Ganoderma_ one of the most significant fungal genera both scientifically and culturally.
