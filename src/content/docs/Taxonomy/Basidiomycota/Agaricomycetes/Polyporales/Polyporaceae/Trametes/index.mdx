# Trametes <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Polyporaceae › **Genus:** Trametes

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Trametes suaveolens_  
* **Authority & year:** Fr., 1836  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Thin, tough bracket fungi, small round pores, often vividly zoned caps, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Trametes** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1836. The name is derived from Latin _trames_ ("crossway" or "path"), referring to the crosswise layered structure of the fruitbody flesh.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Trametes** species are some of the most familiar forest fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are bracket-shaped, thin to moderately thick, tough and leathery.
  - Upper surfaces are dry, often concentrically zoned with colors (white, gray, brown, blue, greenish with algae).
  - Hymenophores are poroid with small round pores, usually white or cream.
  - Flesh is white, fibrous, and layered.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are present.

**Synapomorphies** include concentric zoning, small round pores, white rot decay, and tough fruitbody texture.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Trametes** within Polyporaceae, with close relations to genera like _Polyporus_ and _Lenzites_. Some former _Trametes_ species have been reclassified into separate genera based on DNA evidence (_e.g.,_ _Pycnoporus_, _Coriolopsis_).

The genus represents an evolutionary lineage adapted to efficient wood decomposition under a range of moisture conditions.

Important species include:

- _Trametes versicolor_ (turkey tail)
- _Trametes hirsuta_
- _Trametes pubescens_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Fallen logs, stumps, branches, dead standing trees; in forests, parks, and urban environments.
- **Substrates:** Hardwood (preferred) and occasionally conifer wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across temperate, tropical, and boreal ecosystems.

Species fruit prolifically throughout the year and can persist through winter.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Trametes** fungi are beloved for their ecological importance and beauty:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not generally edible — fruitbodies are too tough, though they are brewed into teas (_e.g.,_ _T. versicolor_) for medicinal use.

- **Medicinal significance:**
  - _Trametes versicolor_ (turkey tail) is famous in traditional and modern medicine for its immune-boosting polysaccharides (PSK and PSP).

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical wood decomposers, facilitating nutrient cycling.
  - Important habitats for invertebrates and secondary decomposers.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Model organisms for white rot enzymatic systems.
  - Studied for potential applications in bioremediation and natural product chemistry.

Their vibrant colors, vital ecosystem functions, and cultural significance make _Trametes_ one of the most important fungal genera worldwide.
