**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Polyporaceae › **Genus:** Lentinus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lentinus edodes_ (formerly the type species; now placed under _Lentinula_)  
* **Authority & year:** Fr., 1825  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Tough-fleshed mushrooms, gilled undersurfaces, leathery to flexible textures, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Lentinus** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1825. The name is derived from Latin _lentus_ ("pliable" or "flexible"), referring to the often tough yet bendable consistency of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lentinus** species are gilled fungi often resembling typical mushrooms but with polypore-like toughness:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are centrally or eccentrically stalked, with broadly convex to funnel-shaped caps.
  - Cap surfaces are dry, sometimes scaly, hairy, or smooth; colors range from white and cream to tan and brown.
  - Undersurfaces have well-developed, sometimes jagged gills that may be decurrent (running down the stalk).
  - Flesh is tough and fibrous.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are present.

**Synapomorphies** include leathery or tough textures, true gills, and a white rot decay lifestyle.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) show that **Lentinus** is polyphyletic in a broad sense, but a narrower, revised concept places it clearly within Polyporaceae, close to true polypores rather than typical agarics.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporaceae
 ├── Polyporus
 ├── Trametes
 ├── Ganoderma
 └── Lentinus
```
The genus represents an intermediate evolutionary step between classic gilled mushrooms and tough polypores.

Important species include:

- _Lentinus tigrinus_ (tiger sawgill)
- _Lentinus sajor-caju_ (edible in parts of Asia)

> (Note: _Lentinus edodes_ — shiitake — is now placed in the related genus _Lentinula_.)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead logs, stumps, decaying wood of hardwoods and conifers.
- **Substrates:** Dead wood; occasionally found on living but weakened trees.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests worldwide.

Species fruit during wet seasons and are commonly seen on fallen timber.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lentinus** fungi are important for ecosystems and, historically, for food:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Lentinus sajor-caju_) are edible and cultivated regionally in Asia.
  - Many species are too tough for culinary use unless very young.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Decomposers of woody debris, crucial for nutrient cycling and forest regeneration.
  - Their white rot capabilities help open up wood for colonization by other fungi and organisms.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Models for studying fungal transitions between gilled mushrooms and tough bracket fungi.

Their flexible toughness, historical culinary use, and importance in wood decay ecology make _Lentinus_ a fascinating genus at the intersection of polypores and agarics.
