# Podofomes <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Polyporaceae › **Genus:** Podofomes

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Podofomes trogii_  
* **Authority & year:** Pat., 1900  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Tough, sessile bracket fungi, poroid undersurface, brownish tones, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Podofomes** was described by **Narcisse Théophile Patouillard** in 1900. The name derives from Greek _podos_ ("foot") and _Fomes_ ("tinder fungus"), alluding to the somewhat foot-like or hoof-shaped appearance of the fruiting bodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Podofomes** species are sturdy, long-lived decomposers:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are bracket-shaped to hoof-shaped, often sessile (attached directly without a stem).
  - Cap surfaces are smooth to roughened, brownish to dark brown, sometimes zoned or cracked with age.
  - Pore surfaces are whitish when young, becoming yellowish or brown with age; pores are small and round.
  - Flesh is tough, fibrous to woody.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to slightly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are often present.

**Synapomorphies** include tough, perennial bracket forms, poroid hymenophores, and efficient white rot decay.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Podofomes** within the Polyporaceae, close to genera like _Polyporus_ and _Trametes_, though relatively distinct based on morphology and genetics.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporaceae
 ├── Polyporus
 ├── Trametes
 └── Podofomes
```
The genus likely evolved to colonize large logs and standing dead trees where long-lasting spore dispersal was advantageous.

Important species:

- _Podofomes trogii_ (the common representative)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead hardwood trunks and logs, occasionally on conifers.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead wood; occasionally weakly parasitic on living trees.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot by decomposing lignin and cellulose.

- **Geographic range:** Recorded in temperate forests across Europe, Asia, and North America.

Species often fruit year-round, remaining conspicuous even in winter.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Podofomes** fungi are important in forest decomposition and wood decay studies:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are too hard and woody.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Contribute to recycling of lignified biomass, supporting soil nutrient enrichment and biodiversity.
  - Create microhabitats in decaying wood for insects and other small organisms.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their role in white rot enzymatic activity and forest wood decay succession.

Their tough persistence, contribution to forest recycling, and understated ecological roles make _Podofomes_ an important genus among the bracket fungi.
