# Fomes <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Polyporaceae › **Genus:** Fomes

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Fomes fomentarius_  
* **Authority & year:** (L.) Fr., 1849  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Tough, woody, perennial bracket fungi, gray to brownish caps, small rounded pores, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Fomes** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1849, building on earlier work by **Carl Linnaeus**. The name _Fomes_ means "tinder" or "kindling" in Latin, referencing the historical use of _Fomes fomentarius_ in fire-starting.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Fomes** species are iconic examples of tough perennial polypores:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are large, perennial, hoof-shaped or bracket-like, extremely hard and woody.
  - Upper surfaces are zoned, smooth to rough, gray, grayish-brown, or blackened with age.
  - Pore surfaces are whitish to grayish, composed of tiny round pores.
  - Context tissue is tough, fibrous, and often displays concentric annual growth layers.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include woody, perennial fruitbodies with small pores and efficient white rot decomposition strategies.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Fomes** within Polyporaceae, distinct from genera like _Polyporus_ and _Trametes_, emphasizing its specialized perennial strategy.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporaceae
 ├── Polyporus
 ├── Trametes
 └── Fomes
```
The genus likely evolved for persistent spore dispersal over multiple years, maximizing reproductive success in harsh environments.

Important species include:

- _Fomes fomentarius_ (tinder polypore or hoof fungus)
- _Fomes fasciatus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Found on dead or living hardwoods (especially birch, beech, alder) and occasionally on conifers.
- **Substrates:** Dead trunks, standing dead trees, fallen logs, and sometimes living trees (causing heart rot).
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic and parasitic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across temperate and boreal forests worldwide.

Species fruit year-round and can persist through extreme weather, from freezing winters to dry summers.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Fomes** fungi have long been important to humans and ecosystems:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are woody and inedible.

- **Traditional uses:**
  - _Fomes fomentarius_ has been historically used for making tinder, medicinal poultices, and even clothing (after specialized processing).

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key decomposers in forest ecosystems, breaking down lignin-rich hardwood material.
  - Create valuable habitat cavities for insects, birds, and small mammals through their decay processes.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for enzymatic breakdown of lignin and potential applications in bioremediation.

Their tough survival, deep historical connection to human cultures, and ecological roles make _Fomes_ one of the most iconic genera among forest fungi.
