**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Laetiporaceae › **Genus:** Phaeolus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Phaeolus schweinitzii_  
* **Authority & year:** Pat., 1900  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Large soft bracket fungi, velvety or woolly surfaces, yellow, brown, greenish coloration, brown rot decay  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Phaeolus** was described by **Narcisse Théophile Patouillard** in 1900. The name is derived from Greek _phaeos_ ("dusky" or "dark") and refers to the typically dark, brownish tones seen in mature specimens.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Phaeolus** species are striking and easily recognized:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are annual, large, and bracket-shaped with irregular, lobed, or undulating margins.
  - Upper surfaces are velvety to woolly when young, often brightly colored yellow, greenish, brown, or rust-red, fading with age.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to olive-brown, with small, round pores.
  - Flesh is soft when fresh but dries tough and fibrous.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline to pale yellow, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include soft fresh textures, woolly caps, brilliant to muted earth-tone colors, and brown rot wood decay.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Phaeolus** within the Laetiporaceae family, alongside _Laetiporus_, despite their distinct appearances.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Laetiporaceae
 ├── Laetiporus
 └── Phaeolus
```
The genus adapted specifically to brown rot decomposition of large coniferous hosts.

Important species:

- _Phaeolus schweinitzii_ (the dyer's polypore or velvet-top fungus)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous forests; associated with living trees, stumps, and fallen trunks.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead or living conifer wood (e.g., spruce, pine, fir).
- **Trophic modes:** Weakly parasitic (heart rot in living trees) and saprotrophic (wood decomposition).

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed in North America, Europe, and Asia; especially common in mountainous and temperate forests.

Species typically fruit from late summer into autumn, especially after wet conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Phaeolus** fungi are culturally important and ecologically significant:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are tough, woody, and sometimes mildly toxic.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important brown rot agents, contributing to nutrient cycling and hollow tree formation (creating wildlife habitat).
  - Pathogenic to timber trees, reducing wood quality through heart rot.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - _Phaeolus schweinitzii_ is historically valued as a natural dye source, producing vibrant yellows, greens, and browns for wool and textiles.
  - Known as "dyer's polypore" in the craft world.

Their velvety textures, bold earthy colors, and dual role as both forest architects and historical dyestuff sources make _Phaeolus_ a truly remarkable fungal genus.
