## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Niveoporofomes spraguei_  
* **Authority & year:** T. Wagner & M. Fisch., 2002  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Woody shelf fungi, tough perennial fruitbodies, white to cream pore surfaces, brown rot, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Niveoporofomes** was described by **Thomas Wagner** and **Michael Fischer** in 2002 to accommodate certain pale-pored brown rot fungi formerly placed in _Fomitopsis_. The name _Niveoporofomes_ combines _niveo-_ ("snowy white") and _Porofomes_ ("having pores like _Fomes_"), emphasizing the pale coloration of the pore surface.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Niveoporofomes** species are robust, tough polypores with distinctive features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are perennial, bracket-shaped, woody, and often large.
  - Upper surfaces are rough, zoned, and colored tan, brown, or grayish.
  - Pore surfaces are white to cream, aging to pale brown.
  - Pores are small and round.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include woody, perennial fruitbodies with pale pore surfaces and brown rot wood decay abilities.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Niveoporofomes** within the Fomitopsidaceae family of Polyporales, close to _Fomitopsis_ but distinct based on DNA and morphological traits.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Fomitopsidaceae
 ├── Fomitopsis
 ├── Daedalea
 └── Niveoporofomes
```
The genus likely evolved specialized adaptations for dry wood environments and persistent spore production over multiple years.

Important species include:

- _Niveoporofomes spraguei_ (the type species, also known as the "white-pored conk")

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead or dying hardwoods, especially oak, maple, and other broadleaf trees.
- **Substrates:** Wood; primarily causing brown rot.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic; decomposing lignified plant material.

- **Geographic range:** Mainly North America (eastern United States and Canada); rare but widely scattered records elsewhere.

Species often persist for many years, building annual growth layers.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Niveoporofomes** fungi are ecologically important wood decay agents:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are too tough and woody.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key decomposers facilitating forest nutrient cycling.
  - Help create habitat for wood-dwelling insects and organisms.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for studies on brown rot enzymology and wood degradation in temperate forests.

Their sturdy structures, white pore surfaces, and role in forest decay processes make _Niveoporofomes_ an important, though often overlooked, genus in fungal biodiversity.
