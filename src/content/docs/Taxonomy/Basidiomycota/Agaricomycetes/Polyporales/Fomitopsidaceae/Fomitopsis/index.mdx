## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Fomitopsis pinicola_  
* **Authority & year:** P. Karst., 1881  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Woody bracket fungi, poroid undersurface, zoned or banded caps, brown rot decay agents, tough perennial fruitbodies  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Fomitopsis** was described by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1881. The name combines _Fomes_ (a related genus of woody shelf fungi) and the Greek suffix _-opsis_ ("appearance"), meaning "having the appearance of _Fomes_," reflecting their resemblance to classic bracket fungi.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Fomitopsis** species are among the most robust polypores:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are perennial, bracket-shaped, hoof-shaped, or crust-like.
  - Upper surfaces are often zoned with concentric bands of different colors (white, brown, reddish, black).
  - Pore surfaces are small-pored, white to brownish with age.
  - Flesh is fibrous, tough, often displaying multiple annual growth layers internally.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include tough perennial fruitbodies, brown rot of wood, and zoned or banded upper surfaces.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb1, rpb2) confirm **Fomitopsis** as a distinct lineage within Fomitopsidaceae, closely related to genera like _Daedalea_ and _Antrodia_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Fomitopsidaceae
 ├── Fomitopsis
 ├── Daedalea
 └── Antrodia
```
The genus evolved specialized mechanisms for efficient brown rot decay, allowing rapid breakdown of cellulose-rich plant tissues.

Important species include:

- _Fomitopsis pinicola_ (red-belted conk)
- _Fomitopsis betulina_ (formerly known as _Piptoporus betulinus_, the birch polypore)
- _Fomitopsis ochracea_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead or dying hardwood and coniferous trees, stumps, and logs.
- **Substrates:** Primarily wood; both hardwoods (e.g., birch) and softwoods (e.g., spruce, pine).
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic; some species also weakly parasitic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; abundant in temperate and boreal forests worldwide.

Species persist year-round, visible even through winter under snow or in dry conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Fomitopsis** fungi are highly significant for ecology, forestry, and even ancient human culture:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are tough and woody.
  - However, some species like _F. betulina_ have historical medicinal uses (antiseptics, wound dressings).

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key decomposers in forests, helping recycle carbon and nutrients.
  - Influence forest succession by breaking down fallen logs and dead standing trees.

- **Scientific and cultural relevance:**
  - _Fomitopsis betulina_ was carried by Ötzi the Iceman (~5,300 years ago) and likely used for medicinal purposes.
  - Model organisms for studying brown rot enzymology and fungal ecology.

Their tough beauty, critical ecological roles, and historical human associations make _Fomitopsis_ one of the most iconic genera among wood-decaying fungi.
