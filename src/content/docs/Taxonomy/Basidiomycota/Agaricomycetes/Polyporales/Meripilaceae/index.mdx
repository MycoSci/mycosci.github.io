# Meripilaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Meripilaceae

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Meripilus giganteus_ (for the type genus _Meripilus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Jülich, 1981  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Fleshy bracket fungi, large clustered fruitbodies, thin-walled hyphal systems, white rot agents  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Meripilaceae** was formally established by **Walter Jülich** in 1981 to distinguish certain fleshy, large, white rot fungi from the tougher, woody polypores. The name derives from _Meripilus_, meaning "divided cap" (_meris_ = part, _pilos_ = cap), referring to their numerous fan-like lobes.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Meripilaceae** fungi are notable for their large, showy growths:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are fleshy, often composed of numerous overlapping fan-shaped or spoon-shaped caps.
  - Caps are soft when young, becoming tougher with age, often gray, brown, or creamy.
  - Hymenophores are poroid with small, round pores.
  - Bruising reactions are common (e.g., caps bruising blackish in some species).

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Hyphal systems are monomitic (only generative hyphae) and thin-walled.

**Synapomorphies** include fleshy to semi-tough textures, small round pores, thin-walled hyphae, and aggressive white rot decay.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Meripilaceae** within Polyporales, closely related to other fleshy polypore groups like _Grifolaceae_ but distinct based on molecular and microscopic characteristics.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporales
 ├── Polyporaceae
 ├── Grifolaceae
 └── Meripilaceae
```
The family likely evolved to rapidly colonize and decompose freshly fallen or weakened hardwoods.

Primary genera:

- _Meripilus_ (type genus)
- _Rhodofomes_ (sometimes included or closely allied)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests, parks, and gardens; typically at the base of hardwoods and sometimes conifers.
- **Substrates:** Living trees (parasitic), dead stumps, and fallen logs.
- **Trophic modes:** White rot decomposers and weak parasites.

- **Geographic range:** Temperate forests of Europe, North America, and Asia; occasionally reported from subtropical regions.

Species fruit mainly during late summer and autumn after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Meripilaceae** fungi are ecologically significant and occasionally collected:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some young specimens of _Meripilus giganteus_ are edible when very tender, though they toughen rapidly and are often bitter.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important agents of wood decay, creating gaps in forests and recycling nutrients.
  - Help open habitat for succession by breaking down old root systems and tree trunks.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their white rot enzymatic systems capable of breaking down lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose.

Their grand clusters, aggressive decomposition abilities, and role in forest turnover make _Meripilaceae_ a quietly vital family within Polyporales.
