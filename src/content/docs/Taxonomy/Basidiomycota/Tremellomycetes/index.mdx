# Tremellomycetes <Badge variant="note" text="Class" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Tremellomycetes

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Class  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Tremella mesenterica_ (for the type genus _Tremella_)  
* **Authority & year:** Liu, White & Hodkinson, 2015 (modern redefinition)  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gelatinous fungi, yeast-like stages common, parasitic or saprotrophic, septate basidia  

## Discovery & Naming
The class **Tremellomycetes** has a long historical usage but was clarified and molecularly defined in its modern sense by **Liu, White, and Hodkinson** in 2015. The name derives from the genus _Tremella_, meaning "trembling" or "quivering," describing the jelly-like consistency of many members.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Tremellomycetes** fungi are diverse but share key features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are gelatinous to rubbery, often lobed, brain-like, or cushion-shaped.
  - Colors are variable: bright yellow, orange, pink, white, brown, or black.
  - Some species are yeast-like and produce no obvious macroscopic structures.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are often longitudinally or obliquely septate (divided into compartments).
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to globose.
  - Many species switch between yeast and hyphal stages.

**Synapomorphies** include gelatinous fruitbodies or yeast stages, septate basidia, and parasitic or saprotrophic lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, SSU) show **Tremellomycetes** as a coherent group within Basidiomycota, distinct from other jelly fungi like Dacrymycetes.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Basidiomycota
 ├── Dacrymycetes
 ├── Agaricomycetes
 └── Tremellomycetes
```
The class evolved both filamentous and yeast-like life cycles, often specializing in parasitizing other fungi.

Major orders:

- _Tremellales_ (including _Tremella_ and allies)
- _Cystofilobasidiales_ (mostly yeasts)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests, woodlands, decaying wood, living plants, and soil.
- **Substrates:** Wood (as parasites of fungi growing on wood), bark, leaves, or free-living in soil and water.
- **Trophic modes:** Primarily parasitic on other fungi (especially crust fungi) or saprotrophic; some are free-living yeasts.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in temperate, tropical, and arctic regions worldwide.

Species often fruit in humid conditions and are short-lived unless in yeast stages.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Tremellomycetes** fungi have both ecological and human relevance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Tremella fuciformis_, "snow fungus") are edible and cultivated for soups and desserts in East Asia.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important fungal parasites, regulating populations of wood-inhabiting fungi.
  - Key players in microbial biodiversity and ecosystem complexity.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important models for fungal evolution (especially yeast transitions).
  - Studied for biotechnological applications (e.g., polysaccharides from _Tremella_ species for cosmetics and medicine).

Their shimmering beauty, fascinating parasitic lifestyles, and importance in fungal evolution make _Tremellomycetes_ one of the most intriguing classes of fungi.
