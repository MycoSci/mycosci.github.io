# Geoglossales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Geoglossomycetes › **Order:** Geoglossales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Geoglossum glabrum_ (for the type genus _Geoglossum_)  
* **Authority & year:** Nannfeldt, 1942  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Earth tongues, dark pigmented fruiting bodies, clavate or tongue-shaped ascocarps, septate and pigmented ascospores  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Geoglossales** was first described by **John Axel Nannfeldt** in 1942. The name comes from the Greek *geo-* (earth) and *glossa* (tongue), referring to the characteristic tongue-shaped fruiting bodies of its members that typically emerge directly from the soil. Initially grouped within broader, morphologically-based categories like the Discomycetes, the molecular revolution in fungal systematics, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s, confirmed Geoglossales as a distinct lineage. Its definition has since narrowed and sharpened based on DNA sequence data, particularly from rDNA and protein-coding genes.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
Members of **Geoglossales** exhibit a fairly cohesive morphological profile:

- **Macroscopic traits:** Small to medium-sized, black or dark brown, club- to tongue-shaped fruiting bodies; surfaces are often smooth or slightly wrinkled.
- **Microscopic traits:** 
  - Asci are elongated, unitunicate, and typically operculate.
  - Ascospores are dark, often multiseptate, and produced in bundles.
  - Paraphyses (sterile filamentous structures among the asci) are often present and may be pigmented.

**Synapomorphies** distinguishing Geoglossales include heavily melanized ascospores and the waxy to rubbery texture of the fruiting body compared to the more brittle discomycetes.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Phylogenetic analyses position **Geoglossales** as a basal clade within the **Geoglossomycetes**. Molecular work, including ribosomal DNA (ITS, LSU) and protein-coding genes (RPB2, TEF1-α), has reinforced the monophyly of Geoglossales.

The order primarily consists of three genera:

- _Geoglossum_
- _Trichoglossum_
- _Sarcoleotia_

**Text-based phylogenetic overview:**
```
Geoglossomycetes
 └── Geoglossales
      ├── Geoglossum (smooth earth tongues)
      ├── Trichoglossum (hairy earth tongues)
      └── Sarcoleotia (gelatinous earth tongues)
```
Divergence within the group likely dates back to the early Cretaceous period, approximately 100–130 million years ago, based on molecular clock estimates.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Prefers unimproved grasslands, mossy forest floors, and heathlands.
- **Substrates:** Soil or moss; occasionally decaying plant material.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, playing a role in decomposition and nutrient cycling.
- **Geographic range:** Global distribution, most common in temperate and boreal zones; rarer in tropical regions.

Species of Geoglossales are often indicators of ancient, undisturbed habitats and are therefore of conservation interest.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
Although not commercially harvested or widely consumed, Geoglossales fungi have ecological importance as indicators of ecosystem health, particularly in European and North American conservation contexts. Several species are included in national Red Lists (e.g., in the UK and Scandinavia) due to habitat loss from agricultural intensification.

Because of their enigmatic appearance and rarity, earth tongues also hold a special place among amateur mycologists and fungal biodiversity enthusiasts.
