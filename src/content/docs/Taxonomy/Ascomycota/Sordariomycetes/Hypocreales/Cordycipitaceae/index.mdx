# Cordycipitaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Sordariomycetes › **Order:** Hypocreales › **Family:** Cordycipitaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Cordyceps militaris_ (for the type genus _Cordyceps_)  
* **Authority & year:** Kreisel, 1969  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Parasitic on insects or other fungi, brightly colored stromata, cylindrical to clavate asci, unitunicate  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Cordycipitaceae** was described by **Hanns Kreisel** in 1969 to formally recognize a distinct lineage of parasitic fungi within Hypocreales. The name derives from the genus _Cordyceps_, which itself is from the Greek _kordyle_ ("club") and _ceps_ ("head"), referencing the club-shaped fruiting bodies typical of many species. While early taxonomy relied heavily on macroscopic form, molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed the natural coherence of this group, especially distinct from related families like _Clavicipitaceae_ and _Ophiocordycipitaceae_.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Cordycipitaceae** fungi are distinguished by their parasitic lifestyle and unique morphology:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Stromata (fruiting structures) are often brightly colored — orange, yellow, red, or pink.
  - Shape varies from club-like, branched, or simple cylindrical forms.
  - Fruiting bodies arise directly from the body of insect hosts, arachnids, or other fungi.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are unitunicate, cylindrical to clavate, and forcibly discharge spores.
  - Ascospores are hyaline, usually filiform (thread-like) and may fragment into part-spores (secondary spores).
  - Paraphyses are present and assist in spore dispersal.

**Synapomorphies** include parasitism on arthropods or fungi, fleshy to leathery stromata, and distinctive spore morphology.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB1, TEF1-α) support **Cordycipitaceae** as a monophyletic family, distinct from _Ophiocordycipitaceae_ (which tends to have darker, leathery stromata) and _Clavicipitaceae_ (plant endophytes and pathogens).

Key genera include:

- _Cordyceps_ (the type genus)
- _Beauveria_
- _Akanthomyces_
- _Isaria_

The family likely diversified during the Cretaceous period, coinciding with the explosion of insect diversity and the spread of angiosperm forests.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, insect-rich environments, tropical to temperate zones.
- **Substrates:** Insect hosts (especially Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera), arachnids, and occasionally other fungi.
- **Trophic modes:** Parasitic (killing the host) and saprotrophic (decomposing remains).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan — especially rich in tropical rainforests, but also present in temperate regions.

Fruiting often occurs after periods of high humidity or rainfall, coinciding with insect activity peaks.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Cordycipitaceae** fungi have profound cultural, medicinal, and economic relevance:

- **Medicinal uses:**
  - _Cordyceps militaris_ and _Cordyceps sinensis_ (now classified as _Ophiocordyceps sinensis_) have long histories of use in traditional Chinese medicine.
  - Studied for potential anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-tumor, and anti-fatigue effects.

- **Biological control:**
  - _Beauveria bassiana_ is widely used as a biocontrol agent against agricultural insect pests.
  - _Isaria fumosorosea_ and related species have applications in pest management.

- **Cultural impact:**
  - Cordyceps fungi have gained popular attention in media, particularly in fictional depictions of parasitic fungi controlling hosts (e.g., in "The Last of Us").

Their fascinating biology and powerful biochemical properties continue to attract significant scientific and commercial interest.
