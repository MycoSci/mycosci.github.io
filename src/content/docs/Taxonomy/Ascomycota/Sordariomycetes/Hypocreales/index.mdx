# Hypocreales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Sordariomycetes › **Order:** Hypocreales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** N/A (Order-level; iconic genera include _Hypocrea_, _Fusarium_, _Trichoderma_)  
* **Authority & year:** Lindau, 1897  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Brightly colored perithecia, unitunicate asci, diverse trophic strategies, saprotrophic, parasitic, or mutualistic  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Hypocreales** was established by **Gustav Lindau** in 1897. The name derives from the Greek _hypo-_ ("under") and _creas_ ("flesh"), possibly referring to the fleshy nature and often embedded fruiting structures (perithecia) within stromatic tissue. Historically grouped by their soft textures and vivid coloration, Hypocreales has been strongly supported as a natural grouping through molecular systematics, showing it contains a range of ecologically important fungi.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hypocreales** fungi are characterized by a set of distinctive traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies (stromata or perithecia) are often brightly colored — yellow, orange, red, or green.
  - Forms range from simple perithecia to complex stromatic structures embedded in host tissue or substrates.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are unitunicate, cylindrical or clavate, with active spore discharge.
  - Ascospores are usually hyaline, smooth to slightly ornamented, and may be septate or non-septate.
  - Paraphyses typically present and assist in spore ejection.

**Synapomorphies** include fleshy, vividly colored fruiting bodies and mostly hyaline ascospores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, TEF1-α, RPB2) confirm that **Hypocreales** is a strongly monophyletic group within Sordariomycetes.

Major families within Hypocreales include:

- _Hypocreaceae_ (e.g., _Hypocrea_, _Trichoderma_)
- _Nectriaceae_ (e.g., _Fusarium_)
- _Clavicipitaceae_ (e.g., _Claviceps_, _Cordyceps_)
- _Ophiocordycipitaceae_ (e.g., _Ophiocordyceps_)
- _Bionectriaceae_

The evolutionary history of Hypocreales dates back to the Mesozoic era (~200–150 million years ago), with major radiations associated with plant hosts, insect hosts, and soil habitats.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Highly varied — soil, wood, plant debris, insect hosts, and animal tissues.
- **Substrates:** Living plants (as pathogens or symbionts), insect bodies, animal dung, decaying organic matter.
- **Trophic modes:**
  - Saprotrophic (decomposers).
  - Plant pathogenic (e.g., _Fusarium_ wilt diseases).
  - Insect pathogenic (e.g., _Cordyceps_ species infecting insects).
  - Endophytic or mutualistic (e.g., _Epichloë_ species in grasses).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; abundant from tropical to temperate ecosystems.

Hypocreales fungi are critical to soil ecosystems, plant health, biological pest control, and pharmaceutical industries.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hypocreales** includes many species of major scientific, agricultural, and medical significance:

- **Plant pathogens:**
  - _Fusarium_ species cause wilt, blight, and root rot in crops worldwide.

- **Biological control and biotechnology:**
  - _Trichoderma_ species are used as biological control agents against plant diseases.
  - _Beauveria_ and _Metarhizium_ species are used in biopesticides for insect control.

- **Medicinal fungi:**
  - _Cordyceps_ and _Ophiocordyceps_ species are important in traditional medicine and studied for immunomodulatory, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory compounds.

- **Economic importance:**
  - Hypocreales fungi impact global agriculture through crop loss, biocontrol solutions, and medicinal applications.

The diversity and adaptability of this order make it one of the most ecologically and economically significant groups of fungi.
