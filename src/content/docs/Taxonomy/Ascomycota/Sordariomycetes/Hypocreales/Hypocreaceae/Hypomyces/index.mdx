## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hypomyces lactifluorum_  
* **Authority & year:** Tulasne & C. Tulasne, 1860  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Mycoparasitic, brightly colored coverings of host fungi, perithecial fruiting bodies, smooth to warted ascospores  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Hypomyces** was established by **Charles and Louis René Tulasne** in 1860. The name derives from the Greek _hypo-_ ("under") and _myces_ ("fungus"), reflecting its parasitic nature — growing over and modifying the appearance of its fungal hosts. Historically recognized for its bizarre transformations of other fungi, molecular studies have confirmed _Hypomyces_ as a cohesive and important group within Hypocreaceae.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hypomyces** species are primarily known for parasitizing and deforming other fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Colonies often appear as crusty, powdery, or felty coverings over host mushrooms.
  - Colors vary from white, yellow, orange, red, to vivid shades depending on the species.
  - Host fungi are often heavily deformed, with distorted caps and gills rendered infertile.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Perithecia (flask-shaped structures) may be embedded within the crust or superficial.
  - Asci are unitunicate, cylindrical, and operculate.
  - Ascospores are hyaline to lightly pigmented, ellipsoid to fusiform, often smooth but sometimes warted or ridged.

**Synapomorphies** include a parasitic lifestyle targeting fungal fruiting bodies and vivid stromatal colors.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2, TEF1-α) strongly support **Hypomyces** as a monophyletic genus within **Hypocreaceae**.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Hypocreaceae
 ├── Hypocrea (Trichoderma)
 ├── Protocrea
 ├── Hypomyces
 └── Sphaerostilbella
```
The genus likely diversified during the Cretaceous to Paleogene periods, specializing on a wide variety of fungal hosts.

Recognized important species include:

- _Hypomyces lactifluorum_ (lobster mushroom)
- _Hypomyces chrysospermus_ (parasitizes boletes)
- _Hypomyces hyalinus_ (attacks _Amanita_ species)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Wherever host fungi are present — forests, woodlands, meadows.
- **Substrates:** Fruiting bodies of various fungi, especially _Russula_, _Lactarius_, _Amanita_, and _Boletus_ species.
- **Trophic modes:** Mycoparasitic — living parasitically on the fruiting bodies of other basidiomycetes.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across temperate and tropical regions.

_Hypomyces_ species are often highly specific to particular fungal hosts.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hypomyces** species have both culinary and ecological significance:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Hypomyces lactifluorum_ ("lobster mushroom") transforms its _Russula_ or _Lactarius_ host into a dense, flavorful, commercially edible mushroom prized by foragers and chefs.
  - Other species (e.g., _H. chrysospermus_) are not edible and can spoil edible mushrooms.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Regulate fungal populations, influencing forest ecosystem dynamics.
  - Potential indicators of fungal biodiversity and ecosystem health.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - _Hypomyces lactifluorum_ is featured in gourmet cooking and mushroom festivals, especially in North America.

Their role as fungal parasites provides fascinating insights into inter-fungal relationships and evolutionary specialization.
