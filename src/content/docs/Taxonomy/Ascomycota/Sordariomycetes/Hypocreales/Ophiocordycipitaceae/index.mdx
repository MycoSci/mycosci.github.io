# Ophiocordycipitaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Sordariomycetes › **Order:** Hypocreales › **Family:** Ophiocordycipitaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Ophiocordyceps unilateralis_ (for the type genus _Ophiocordyceps_)  
* **Authority & year:** Sung, Sung, Hywel-Jones & Spatafora, 2007  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Dark, leathery to fibrous stromata, parasitic on insects, especially ants, operculate asci, fragmented ascospores  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Ophiocordycipitaceae** was established by **Gi-Ho Sung, Jong-Chul Sung, Nigel Hywel-Jones, and John W. Spatafora** in 2007 following major molecular revisions of the traditional _Cordyceps_ group. The name _Ophiocordyceps_ combines _ophio-_ (Greek for "snake") and _Cordyceps_, referencing the slender, serpentine stromata of many species. This family includes some of the most famous insect-parasitizing fungi, especially those inducing behavioral manipulation ("zombie ants").

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Ophiocordycipitaceae** fungi share distinctive and fascinating features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Stromata (fruiting bodies) are dark brown to black, fibrous, tough, often slender or whip-like.
  - Fruiting structures emerge from living or dead insect hosts, especially ants, wasps, and spiders.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are unitunicate, cylindrical, with an operculum for active spore discharge.
  - Ascospores are hyaline, slender, and often break into secondary part-spores (fragmented spores).
  - Perithecia are embedded in the stromatal tissue.

**Synapomorphies** include leathery to fibrous dark stromata and highly specialized parasitism on arthropods.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB1, TEF1-α) clearly separate **Ophiocordycipitaceae** from _Cordycipitaceae_ (bright-colored fungi) and _Clavicipitaceae_ (primarily plant-associated fungi).

Key genera include:

- _Ophiocordyceps_ (the type genus)
- _Tolypocladium_
- _Drechmeria_
- _Hirsutella_ (now mostly within _Ophiocordyceps_)

The family likely diversified during the Cretaceous, evolving alongside the radiation of social insects like ants and wasps.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Humid forests, tropical and subtropical regions, occasionally temperate woodlands.
- **Substrates:** Insects (especially Formicidae—ants), other arthropods, and insect larvae.
- **Trophic modes:** Obligate parasitic, often inducing behavioral changes in hosts.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed globally, but especially diverse in tropical rainforests (Amazon Basin, Southeast Asia, Central Africa).

_Ophiocordyceps_ species often fruit from elevated vegetation after manipulating host behavior to optimize spore dispersal.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Ophiocordycipitaceae** fungi are of major scientific, medicinal, and cultural interest:

- **Behavioral manipulation:**
  - _Ophiocordyceps unilateralis_ famously manipulates infected ants to climb vegetation and bite into stems before dying ("zombie ant" phenomenon).
  - These fungi then fruit through the ant's body, ensuring effective spore dispersal.

- **Medicinal relevance:**
  - _Ophiocordyceps sinensis_ (formerly _Cordyceps sinensis_) is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine as a tonic for stamina, immunity, and vitality.
  - Wild-harvested _O. sinensis_ commands extremely high prices and is a major source of income in the Tibetan Plateau region.

- **Conservation concerns:**
  - Overharvesting and climate change threaten wild populations of medicinally valuable species like _O. sinensis_.
  - Many tropical species are still undescribed, highlighting the importance of fungal biodiversity conservation.

These fungi are central to studies of parasitism, host-pathogen interactions, and the evolution of complex life cycles.
