# Sordariomycetes <Badge variant="note" text="Class" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Sordariomycetes

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Class  
* **Type species (if applicable):** N/A (Class-level; iconic genera include _Neurospora_, _Fusarium_, _Sordaria_)  
* **Authority & year:** O.E. Eriksson & Winka, 1997  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Perithecial (flask-shaped) fruiting bodies, unitunicate asci, forcible spore discharge, diverse ecological roles  

## Discovery & Naming
**Sordariomycetes** was established as a formal class by **Ove Erik Eriksson and Katarina Winka** in 1997, reflecting advancements in molecular systematics that reorganized the Ascomycota. The name derives from the genus _Sordaria_, a well-known model organism for genetic studies. Historically, Sordariomycetes included many fungi characterized by perithecia—flask-shaped, often embedded fruiting structures—and this morphological trait, along with DNA evidence, continues to define the group.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sordariomycetes** fungi exhibit a range of structures but share core features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Perithecial ascomata (fruiting bodies), often dark-colored and flask- or globose-shaped.
  - Ostiole (opening) present at the top through which spores are discharged.
  - Structures can be solitary, clustered, or embedded in stromatic tissues.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are unitunicate (single-walled), typically cylindrical or club-shaped, and discharge spores forcibly.
  - Ascospores are diverse—hyaline to pigmented, smooth to ornamented, often septate.
  - Paraphyses or pseudoparaphyses often present.

**Synapomorphies** include perithecial development, forcible spore release from asci, and diverse ascospore morphologies.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2, TEF1, and others) reveal that **Sordariomycetes** is a monophyletic and internally diverse class within **Pezizomycotina**.

Major orders include:

- _Sordariales_ (e.g., _Sordaria_, _Neurospora_)
- _Hypocreales_ (e.g., _Fusarium_, _Trichoderma_)
- _Xylariales_ (e.g., _Xylaria_, _Hypoxylon_)
- _Diaporthales_ (e.g., _Cryphonectria_)
- _Ophiostomatales_ (e.g., _Ophiostoma_—Dutch elm disease pathogen)

The group likely arose during the early to mid-Paleozoic (~400–300 million years ago), coinciding with the colonization of terrestrial environments by plants and complex organic substrates.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Ubiquitous—forests, grasslands, aquatic environments, soils, decaying wood, living plants and animals.
- **Substrates:** Wide range, including plant material, dung, wood, soil, insects, and lichens.
- **Trophic modes:**
  - Saprotrophic (decomposers).
  - Pathogenic (on plants, animals, and other fungi).
  - Mutualistic (e.g., endophytes in plants).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; dominant in both temperate and tropical ecosystems.

Sordariomycetes fungi are key players in ecosystem nutrient cycling and plant health dynamics.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sordariomycetes** fungi have profound economic and scientific importance:

- **Pathogens:**
  - _Fusarium_ species cause major plant diseases (wilt, rot).
  - _Cryphonectria parasitica_ (chestnut blight) devastated American chestnut populations.
  - _Ophiostoma ulmi_ and _O. novo-ulmi_ cause Dutch elm disease.

- **Industrial and agricultural uses:**
  - _Trichoderma_ species are used as biological control agents against plant pathogens.
  - _Neurospora crassa_ is a classic model organism in genetics and molecular biology.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Decomposers of wood, dung, and organic debris.
  - Important endophytes and symbionts in various plants.

The diversity and versatility of Sordariomycetes make them crucial to both natural ecosystems and human economies.
