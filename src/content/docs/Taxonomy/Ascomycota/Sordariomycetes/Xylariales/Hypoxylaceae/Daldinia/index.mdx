**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Sordariomycetes › **Order:** Xylariales › **Family:** Hypoxylaceae › **Genus:** Daldinia

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Daldinia concentrica_  
* **Authority & year:** Cesati & De Notaris, 1863  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Woody, charcoal-like stromata, concentric zoning in cross-section, embedded perithecia, pigmented ascospores  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Daldinia** was described by **Vincenzo de Cesati** and **Giuseppe De Notaris** in 1863. It was named in honor of **Agostino Daldini**, a Swiss clergyman and naturalist. _Daldinia_ species were distinguished early on by their striking internal structure of concentric zones, a feature that remains diagnostic. Recent molecular studies place _Daldinia_ within Hypoxylaceae, although some historical treatments considered it part of Xylariaceae.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Daldinia** species are distinctive in both external appearance and internal structure:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Stromata are usually globose to pulvinate (cushion-like) or hemispherical.
  - Outer surface typically smooth, dark brown to black, with a hard, woody texture.
  - In cross-section, stromata reveal conspicuous concentric rings of different densities or colors.
  - Size ranges from a few centimeters to larger fruiting bodies up to 10 cm across.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Perithecia are embedded in the stromatal tissue, opening via tiny ostioles.
  - Asci are unitunicate, cylindrical, with a prominent apical apparatus (often amyloid).
  - Ascospores are dark brown to black, ellipsoid, often with a straight or slightly curved germ slit.

**Synapomorphies** include the concentric internal zoning and dark, carbonaceous stromata.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Daldinia** within the core **Hypoxylaceae**, related closely to _Hypoxylon_ and _Annulohypoxylon_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Hypoxylaceae
 ├── Hypoxylon
 ├── Daldinia
 ├── Annulohypoxylon
 └── Jackrogersella
```
The genus likely diversified alongside woody plant ecosystems during the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, adapting to niches in forest detritus.

Important species include:

- _Daldinia concentrica_ (the classic "King Alfred’s cake" or "cramp ball")
- _Daldinia childiae_
- _Daldinia vernicosa_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Decaying wood of broadleaf trees, especially fallen branches and logs.
- **Substrates:** Dead or dying hardwoods, occasionally conifers; particularly common on ash (_Fraxinus_), beech (_Fagus_), and oak (_Quercus_).
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing lignocellulosic materials.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions across Europe, North America, Asia, and Australasia.

Fruiting typically occurs in moist, shaded forests and is visible year-round due to the durable nature of the stromata.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Daldinia** has interesting cultural and ecological significance:

- **Traditional uses:**
  - _Daldinia concentrica_ ("King Alfred’s cakes") was historically used as a natural tinder for fire starting due to its ability to smolder when dry.
  
- **Ecological importance:**
  - Plays a vital role in wood decomposition and nutrient cycling.
  - Serves as a habitat for specialized insects and microfauna.

- **Chemical research:**
  - Some species produce secondary metabolites of interest for their antimicrobial or antioxidant properties, although less studied than _Hypoxylon_.

- **Folklore:**
  - The concentric rings inside _D. concentrica_ inspired myths and names in European folklore, such as associating them with old fires or cramp cures.

Their durable, dark fruiting bodies make _Daldinia_ species a familiar and iconic sight in many forest ecosystems.
