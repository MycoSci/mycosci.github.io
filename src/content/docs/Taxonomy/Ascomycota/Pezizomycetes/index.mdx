# Pezizomycetes <Badge variant="note" text="Class" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Pezizomycetes

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Class  
* **Type species (if applicable):** N/A (Class-level; iconic genera include _Peziza_ and _Morchella_)  
* **Authority & year:** O.E. Eriksson & Winka, 1997  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Operculate asci, fleshy to brittle apothecia, cup fungi, often brightly colored  

## Discovery & Naming
**Pezizomycetes** was defined by **Ove Erik Eriksson and Katarina Winka** in 1997, based on advances in molecular systematics that restructured the Ascomycota. The name derives from the genus _Peziza_, one of the largest and most typical groups of cup fungi. Historically, these fungi were part of a broad "Discomycetes" category based on their open, cup-like fruiting bodies, but Pezizomycetes was separated based on key microscopic and molecular characteristics, particularly the operculate asci.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
Members of **Pezizomycetes** share several diagnostic features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies (apothecia) are typically cup- or disc-shaped, sometimes saddle-shaped (e.g., morels).
  - Textures range from fleshy to brittle; colors vary widely (brown, purple, yellow, black).
  - Size varies from a few millimeters to large, conspicuous structures (up to 15 cm across).

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are **operculate**, meaning they open with a lid-like structure to release spores.
  - Ascospores are usually forcibly discharged.
  - Paraphyses are abundant, often pigmented, and may contribute to the apothecium's coloration.

**Synapomorphies** for the class include operculate asci and fleshy to brittle, often cup-like apothecia.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2, TEF1-α, and others) place **Pezizomycetes** as an early-diverging class within the **Pezizomycotina**, alongside classes like Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes.

Major orders within Pezizomycetes include:

- _Pezizales_ (largest, including true cup fungi and morels)
- _Ascobolales_ (coprophilous fungi, growing on dung)

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

Pezizomycotina
 ├── Pezizomycetes
      ├── Pezizales
      └── Ascobolales
 ├── Leotiomycetes
 ├── Sordariomycetes
 └── Dothideomycetes
```
The divergence of Pezizomycetes is ancient, likely originating during the early Paleozoic (~400 million years ago), possibly paralleling early land plant diversification.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Varied—forest floors, grasslands, deserts, burnt ground, dung.
- **Substrates:** Soil, decaying organic matter, dung, post-fire environments.
- **Trophic modes:**
  - Saprotrophic (decomposers).
  - Ectomycorrhizal (e.g., some _Tuber_ spp., truffles).
  - Coprophilous (growing on animal dung).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan—found worldwide across temperate, tropical, and arctic ecosystems.

Some Pezizomycetes specialize in extreme habitats such as fire-affected soils and arid regions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
Several Pezizomycetes are of major cultural and economic importance:

- **Edible species:**
  - _Morchella_ spp. (morels)—highly prized edible fungi.
  - _Tuber_ spp. (truffles)—luxury culinary items.
- **Toxic species:**
  - _Gyromitra_ spp. (false morels)—contain dangerous hydrazine toxins if not properly prepared.
- **Ecological roles:**
  - Critical decomposers in nutrient cycling.
  - Key symbionts (truffles) for various tree species in forest ecosystems.

Pezizomycetes are also widely studied for their unique reproductive strategies and spore discharge mechanisms.
