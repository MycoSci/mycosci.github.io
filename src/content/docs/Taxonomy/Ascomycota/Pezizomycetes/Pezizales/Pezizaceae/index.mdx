## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Peziza vesiculosa_ (for the type genus _Peziza_)  
* **Authority & year:** Dumortier, 1829  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Cup-shaped ascocarps, operculate asci, smooth or ornamented spores, saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Pezizaceae** was established by **Barthélemy Charles Joseph Dumortier** in 1829. It is named after the genus _Peziza_, one of the most iconic groups of cup fungi. Early taxonomists grouped a wide variety of fleshy, open-cupped fungi under _Peziza_ and its relatives, but molecular studies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries have clarified Pezizaceae as a distinct, cohesive group within the Pezizales, based on shared microscopic and genetic features.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Pezizaceae** members are unified by several key characteristics:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Ascocarps are typically cup- or saucer-shaped, sometimes becoming flattened with age.
  - Colors range from white, beige, and brown to brilliant violet, orange, or even blue in some species.
  - Textures can be fleshy, rubbery, or brittle.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate, discharging spores via a lid-like opening.
  - Ascospores are smooth to finely ornamented, usually ellipsoid to globose, hyaline to pigmented.
  - Paraphyses are abundant and may be pigmented, contributing to hymenial coloration.

**Synapomorphies** for Pezizaceae include operculate asci, fleshy open apothecia, and diverse spore morphology often adapted for aerial dispersal.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (using ITS, LSU, RPB2, EF-1α) confirm that **Pezizaceae** forms a monophyletic clade within the Pezizales.

Major genera within Pezizaceae include:

- _Peziza_ (the type genus; classic cup fungi)
- _Ascobolus_ (some coprophilous species)
- _Pachyella_
- _Iodophanus_

The family is ancient, with fossil-calibrated divergence estimates placing its origins back to the early Mesozoic (~200–180 million years ago).

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Varied — forest soils, grasslands, dunes, post-fire landscapes, animal dung (for coprophilous species).
- **Substrates:** Soil, sand, decaying organic matter, dung, charred wood.
- **Trophic modes:** 
  - Predominantly saprotrophic.
  - Some species (especially among truffle-like derivatives) are ectomycorrhizal.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; species are found worldwide from tropical rainforests to arctic tundras.

Many species are pioneers in disturbed habitats and play important roles in soil formation and nutrient cycling.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Pezizaceae** fungi are more important ecologically than economically, but some species are culturally notable:

- **Edibility:**
  - A few _Peziza_ species are edible when cooked, but many are considered inedible or of poor culinary quality due to texture or mild toxicity.
  - Some colorful species (e.g., _Peziza badia_) are foraged locally but must be prepared cautiously.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Crucial decomposers of organic matter, aiding in the breakdown of leaf litter, wood, and dung.
  - Some species are adapted to post-fire environments, colonizing burned ground and stabilizing soils.

- **Medical and industrial relevance:**
  - Research into secondary metabolites and bioactive compounds is ongoing, though no major industrial uses have been established yet.

Their diversity and adaptability make Pezizaceae important ecological indicators in many ecosystems.
