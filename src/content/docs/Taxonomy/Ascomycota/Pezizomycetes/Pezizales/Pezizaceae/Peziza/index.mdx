**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Pezizomycetes › **Order:** Pezizales › **Family:** Pezizaceae › **Genus:** Peziza

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Peziza vesiculosa_  
* **Authority & year:** Dillenius ex Fries, 1822  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Cup fungi, fleshy to brittle apothecia, operculate asci, smooth to finely ornamented spores, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Peziza** was formally established by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1822, building on earlier references by **Johann Jacob Dillenius**. The name _Peziza_ likely stems from a classical Latin term for a soft, edible fungus, reflecting the fleshy, open form typical of the group. Early taxonomic work grouped a large variety of "cup fungi" under _Peziza_, but molecular phylogenetics has since refined its circumscription within Pezizaceae, leaving _Peziza_ as a large, diverse, but monophyletic genus.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Peziza** species share several easily recognizable traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Ascocarps are cup- or saucer-shaped when young, often expanding and flattening with age.
  - Size ranges from a few centimeters to 15 cm across in some species.
  - Colors vary widely — from pale creams and browns to vibrant violets, blues, or oranges.
  - Flesh is typically brittle or rubbery when fresh, drying to a fragile texture.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate, cylindrical, unitunicate, and forcibly discharge spores.
  - Ascospores are usually hyaline or lightly pigmented, smooth to finely ornamented.
  - Paraphyses are abundant and often contribute to apothecial color through pigmentation.

**Synapomorphies** include the fleshy cup morphology, operculate asci, and smooth or slightly ornamented spore walls.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Peziza** solidly within **Pezizaceae**, with multiple internal species groups corresponding to different ecological and morphological types.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Pezizaceae
 ├── Peziza
 ├── Legaliana
 ├── Paragalactinia
 └── Ascobolus
```
The genus likely dates back to the early Mesozoic (~200 million years ago), diversifying alongside forest soil ecosystems.

Important species include:

- _Peziza vesiculosa_ (type species)
- _Peziza badia_ (bay cup)
- _Peziza repanda_
- _Peziza domiciliana_ (often found indoors or in greenhouses)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Broad — from temperate forests and grasslands to deserts, urban environments, and burned ground.
- **Substrates:** Soil, sand, charred wood, compost heaps, decaying organic matter.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, playing crucial roles in organic matter decomposition and soil stabilization.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; _Peziza_ species are found on every continent, including extreme environments like tundras and post-wildfire landscapes.

Many species are early colonizers of disturbed soils, especially after fires.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Peziza** species are generally more ecologically important than economically valuable:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species are reportedly edible when young and cooked (e.g., _Peziza badia_), but most are considered of low culinary value or mildly toxic.
  - Raw consumption is strongly discouraged due to possible gastrointestinal irritants.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Pioneers of nutrient cycling, particularly in post-fire and disturbed ecosystems.
  - Some species like _Peziza domiciliana_ have adapted to human environments, growing in greenhouses, gardens, and even homes.

- **Research significance:**
  - _Peziza_ species have been model organisms for studying fungal development, spore dispersal, and adaptation to environmental stress.

Their colorful diversity makes them favorites among amateur mycologists and fungal photographers.
