## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Paragalactinia succosa_  
* **Authority & year:** J. Moravec, 2004  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Cup-shaped or disc-like ascocarps, operculate asci, moist fleshy fruiting bodies, dark pigmented spores  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Paragalactinia** was created by **Josef Moravec** in 2004 to recognize a distinct clade within the Pezizaceae previously included in broader _Peziza_-like groupings. The name _Paragalactinia_ suggests an affinity to (or resemblance with) _Galactinia_, another historically referenced genus of cup fungi. This revision was prompted by advances in both fine-scale morphological analysis and molecular phylogenetics, showing clear distinctions in apothecial form and spore characters.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Paragalactinia** species share distinct morphological traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Ascocarps are cup-shaped to shallowly disc-like when mature, often expanding broadly with age.
  - Flesh is relatively thick and moist when fresh, drying to a rubbery or leathery consistency.
  - Colors are typically brown, dark gray, or ochre.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate, cylindrical, and unitunicate, discharging spores forcibly.
  - Ascospores are pigmented (brown to dark brown), smooth to finely roughened, ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid.
  - Paraphyses are numerous, sometimes slightly swollen at the tips.

**Synapomorphies** include fleshy, relatively thick-walled apothecia with dark spores and robust asci, distinguishing _Paragalactinia_ from genera like _Peziza_ and _Legaliana_.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, and other ribosomal markers) position **Paragalactinia** as a distinct but closely related lineage within the Pezizaceae.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Pezizaceae
 ├── Peziza
 ├── Legaliana
 ├── Paragalactinia
 └── Ascobolus
```
The divergence of _Paragalactinia_ likely dates to the later Cenozoic, reflecting adaptations to specific soil moisture and organic conditions.

Recognized species include:

- _Paragalactinia succosa_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Humid, organic-rich soils of temperate forests; often associated with mosses, decaying logs, or leaf litter.
- **Substrates:** Soil, humus layers, sometimes lightly burned or disturbed ground.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down organic material and contributing to nutrient cycling.

- **Geographic range:** Known from parts of Europe; potential wider distribution not yet fully documented due to rarity and collection biases.

Fruiting typically occurs after rains in spring to early summer.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Paragalactinia** fungi are primarily of scientific interest:

- **Edibility:** Unknown; not recommended for consumption due to lack of culinary tradition and limited chemical analysis.
- **Ecological importance:** Important soil decomposers, aiding forest ecosystem health and organic matter turnover.

Their discovery and characterization highlight the continuing refinement of fungal taxonomy through integration of morphology and molecular data.
