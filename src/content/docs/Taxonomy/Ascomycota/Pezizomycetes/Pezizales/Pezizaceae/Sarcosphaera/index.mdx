## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sarcosphaera coronaria_  
* **Authority & year:** Dumortier, 1822  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Crown-like or split-cup ascocarps, thick fleshy tissue, operculate asci, vivid lavender to lilac hues  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Sarcosphaera** was described by **Barthélemy Charles Joseph Dumortier** in 1822. The name combines Greek roots *sarco-* (σάρξ, "flesh") and *sphaera* (σφαῖρα, "sphere"), referring to the fleshy, initially spherical or rounded ascocarps that later split open into star-like or crown-shaped forms. Historically grouped with similar Pezizales fungi, modern molecular studies have confirmed _Sarcosphaera_ as a distinct lineage within Pezizaceae.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sarcosphaera** species are among the more striking and distinctive cup fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies begin as globose or subterranean structures, then split open into lobed, crown-like forms.
  - Thick, fleshy texture, often white internally and colored lavender, lilac, or bluish on the outer surface.
  - Typically 5–12 cm in diameter when fully expanded.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate, cylindrical, unitunicate, and contain 8 spores.
  - Ascospores are smooth, hyaline (colorless), ellipsoid, and often slightly pointed at one end.
  - Paraphyses are abundant, often with slightly swollen tips.

**Synapomorphies** include the unique splitting of the ascocarp into a "crown" and the vivid pigmentation of the fruiting body, differentiating _Sarcosphaera_ from other Pezizaceae genera like _Peziza_.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU rDNA, RPB2) place **Sarcosphaera** within the core **Pezizaceae** but as an isolated lineage distinct from _Peziza_ and _Ascobolus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Pezizaceae
 ├── Peziza
 ├── Legaliana
 ├── Sarcosphaera
 └── Paragalactinia
```
_Sarcosphaera_ likely diverged from other Pezizaceae lineages during the early Cenozoic, adapting to cooler, montane environments.

Known species include:

- _Sarcosphaera coronaria_ (the "violet crown-cup")

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous and mixed forests, particularly in montane and alpine zones; often associated with well-drained, calcareous soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in organic matter; occasionally lightly buried under moss or duff layers.
- **Trophic modes:** Likely saprotrophic, but some evidence suggests facultative mycorrhizal associations with conifers.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed in temperate regions of Europe and North America, rarer in Asia.

Fruitings typically occur in spring and early summer following snowmelt or seasonal rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sarcosphaera** has limited but notable cultural and ecological relevance:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Sarcosphaera coronaria_ has a complex reputation — historically consumed in parts of Europe, but now generally **considered poisonous**.
  - It may accumulate high levels of toxic heavy metals (e.g., arsenic) from the soil, posing a serious health risk even if properly cooked.

- **Conservation status:**
  - In some regions (e.g., parts of Central Europe), _Sarcosphaera_ populations are declining and considered vulnerable or near threatened.
  - Sensitive to habitat disturbance and soil compaction.

- **Ecological role:**
  - As a decomposer and possible weak symbiont, it contributes to nutrient cycling in montane forest ecosystems.

Its bizarre crown-like fruiting form makes it a favorite among photographers and mycological enthusiasts.
