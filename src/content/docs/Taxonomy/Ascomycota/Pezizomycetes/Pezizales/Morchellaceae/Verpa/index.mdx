## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Verpa bohemica_  
* **Authority & year:** Swartz ex Persoon, 1818  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Early morels, attached cap apex, hollow stem, wrinkled or lobed ascocarps, operculate asci  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Verpa** was described by **Olof Swartz** and later formalized by **Christiaan Hendrik Persoon** in 1818. The name _Verpa_ is derived from Latin, meaning "rod" or "staff," reflecting the long-stemmed, cap-topped form of these fungi. Historically, _Verpa_ species were often confused with true morels (_Morchella_), but detailed morphological and later molecular analyses have justified their separation into a distinct genus within Morchellaceae.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Verpa** species can be differentiated from true morels and other Morchellaceae members by key traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Ascocarps resemble morels but with a bell- or thimble-shaped cap attached only at the apex to the stipe (free hanging on sides).
  - Stipes are long, hollow, and often fragile or brittle when handled.
  - The cap surface is wrinkled, folded, or lobed, but not deeply pitted like true morels.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate and unitunicate, typically containing 8 spores.
  - Ascospores are smooth, hyaline, elliptical to slightly fusiform.
  - Paraphyses are numerous and embedded in the fertile layer.

**Synapomorphies** include the free-hanging cap structure and smooth, hollow stipe, differentiating _Verpa_ from _Morchella_ and _Disciotis_.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Verpa** within **Morchellaceae**, but clearly separated from _Morchella_ and _Disciotis_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Morchellaceae
 ├── Morchella
 ├── Verpa
 └── Disciotis
```
_Verpa_ likely diverged from other Morchellaceae genera during the Paleogene period, adapting to early-spring fruiting in temperate forests.

Notable species include:

- _Verpa bohemica_ (early morel or "wrinkled thimble-cap")
- _Verpa conica_ (smooth thimble-cap)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist, sandy soils near streams, riverbanks, and floodplains; early successional forests.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in decaying organic matter, especially in recently thawed or disturbed areas.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, sometimes appearing in association with hardwood trees.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across North America and Europe; also reported in temperate parts of Asia.

_Verpa_ species often fruit very early in the spring, sometimes weeks before true morels appear.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Verpa** fungi are of mixed culinary reputation:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Verpa bohemica_ and _Verpa conica_ are eaten in some regions after careful cooking.
  - However, they contain small amounts of thermolabile toxins and must be thoroughly cooked to avoid gastrointestinal symptoms.
  - Some mycologists recommend avoiding _Verpa_ altogether due to variability in individual tolerance.

- **Economic importance:**
  - _Verpa_ species are less commercially valued than true morels, but they are collected by foragers during early spring when few other mushrooms are available.

- **Cautionary notes:**
  - Because of their superficial resemblance to true morels, they are sometimes mistakenly harvested, and proper identification is important for foragers.
