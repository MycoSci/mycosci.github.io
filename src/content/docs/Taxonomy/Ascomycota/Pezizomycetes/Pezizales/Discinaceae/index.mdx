## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Discina perlata_ (for the type genus _Discina_)  
* **Authority & year:** Benedix, 1961  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Saddle-shaped to cup-like ascocarps, wrinkled or lobed hymenium, operculate asci, edible and toxic species  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Discinaceae** was established by **Benedix** in 1961 to separate a group of saddle-shaped or irregularly lobed fungi from more typical cup fungi of the Pezizaceae. The name comes from the genus _Discina_, referring to the often disc- or saddle-shaped fruiting bodies. Initially based on morphology, later molecular studies have confirmed that Discinaceae is a distinct lineage within Pezizales, closely allied to families containing morels (_Morchellaceae_).

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Discinaceae** species display a variety of unique macroscopic and microscopic traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies often saddle-shaped, irregular, or deeply lobed.
  - Textures are fleshy, somewhat brittle when dry.
  - Coloration ranges from brown and olive to tan and reddish.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate, cylindrical, and unitunicate, typically containing eight ascospores.
  - Ascospores are hyaline, smooth to finely ornamented, often elliptical to fusiform.
  - Paraphyses are abundant and may be pigmented.

**Synapomorphies** include saddle-shaped to lobed ascocarps and operculate asci adapted for forcible spore discharge.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies using ITS, LSU, and protein-coding genes support **Discinaceae** as a monophyletic group closely related to _Morchellaceae_ (morels) within Pezizales.

Recognized genera include:

- _Discina_ (e.g., _Discina perlata_, "pig’s ears")
- _Gyromitra_ (false morels, some species toxic)
- _Hydnotrya_ (hypogeous or truffle-like forms)

The diversification of Discinaceae likely occurred during the early to mid-Mesozoic, associated with forest ecosystem expansions.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist forest floors, especially in spring and early summer; some species adapted to fire-affected soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in organic material; often associated with decaying wood or mossy soils.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, with possible weak mycorrhizal tendencies in some genera (e.g., _Hydnotrya_).

- **Geographic range:** Widespread in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia; rare in tropical zones.

Certain species, especially in _Gyromitra_, are specialists in cold-temperate or boreal environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Discinaceae** includes both prized edibles and dangerously toxic fungi:

- **Edible species:**
  - _Discina perlata_ ("pig’s ears") — consumed after thorough cooking to eliminate toxins.

- **Toxic species:**
  - _Gyromitra esculenta_ (false morel) — can cause fatal poisoning if improperly prepared; contains hydrazine toxins (e.g., gyromitrin).

- **Economic impact:**
  - Some _Gyromitra_ species are collected and consumed locally (with caution), particularly in Europe and parts of North America.
  - Species like _Hydnotrya_ have niche culinary value as truffle analogs.

Public health advisories often warn against consuming wild _Gyromitra_ due to variability in toxicity among individuals and cooking practices.
