## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Gyromitra esculenta_  
* **Authority & year:** Fries, 1849  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** False morels, saddle- to brain-shaped ascocarps, wrinkled lobed surfaces, operculate asci, potential toxicity  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Gyromitra** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1849. The name derives from Greek roots: *gyros* (γῦρος, "circle" or "coil") and *mitra* (μίτρα, "headband" or "turban"), referring to the contorted, convoluted appearance of their fruiting bodies. Historically, _Gyromitra_ species were confused with edible morels (_Morchella_), but differences in morphology, chemistry, and later, molecular evidence have firmly separated the two genera.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Gyromitra** species are highly distinctive among the Discinaceae:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Ascocarps are typically irregular, brain-like, or saddle-shaped.
  - Lobed and wrinkled hymenia; often reddish-brown, tan, or dark brown.
  - Stipes are stout, chambered, and may be fused with the cap or distinct.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate, cylindrical, and usually contain 8 spores.
  - Ascospores are smooth or finely warted, often elliptical to fusiform.
  - Paraphyses are abundant and often intertwined among asci.

**Synapomorphies** include the twisted, highly lobed or folded cap surfaces, operculate asci, and characteristic spore morphology.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Gyromitra** as a monophyletic group within **Discinaceae**, closely related to _Discina_ and _Hydnotrya_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Discinaceae
 ├── Discina
 ├── Gyromitra
 └── Hydnotrya
```
The genus likely arose during the Mesozoic, with diversification tied to the emergence of temperate and boreal forest ecosystems.

Prominent species include:

- _Gyromitra esculenta_ (false morel)
- _Gyromitra gigas_
- _Gyromitra infula_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous and mixed forests; sandy soils; disturbed areas such as post-fire landscapes.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in organic matter, decaying wood, mossy ground, occasionally charred substrates.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic; decomposing organic debris, sometimes appearing after snowmelt in spring.

- **Geographic range:** Broadly distributed across North America, Europe, and Asia, particularly common in temperate and boreal climates.

Many _Gyromitra_ species are spring-fruiting, appearing shortly after snowmelt.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Gyromitra** is culturally important but controversial:

- **Edibility and toxicity:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Gyromitra esculenta_) have a long history of consumption in parts of Europe and North America after careful preparation (repeated boiling and discarding water).
  - However, _Gyromitra_ species can contain **gyromitrin**, a toxin metabolized into monomethylhydrazine (MMH), a compound causing severe poisoning or death.
  - Consumption of raw or improperly prepared false morels is **extremely dangerous**.

- **Economic impact:**
  - Despite risks, false morels are commercially sold in certain regions, particularly in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, where regulations require warning labels or specific preparation advice.

- **Medical relevance:**
  - Poisonings can lead to gastrointestinal, neurological, and hepatic symptoms, with severe cases resulting in fatalities.

Because of the variable toxicity (even within a species), most modern mycological and public health organizations recommend avoiding consumption of _Gyromitra_ fungi altogether.
