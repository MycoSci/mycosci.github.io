## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Discina perlata_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) Fr., 1849  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Pig's ears fungi, saddle- or disc-shaped ascocarps, wrinkled surface, operculate asci  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Discina** was first described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1849. The name _Discina_ refers to the disc-like shape of the ascocarps in many species (from Latin *discus*, meaning "disc" or "plate"). Early classifications based primarily on macromorphology grouped _Discina_ with other irregularly shaped cup fungi, but molecular studies have confirmed its distinctiveness within the family Discinaceae, close to related genera like _Gyromitra_.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
Species of **Discina** are recognized by a set of unique features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Ascocarps are saddle-shaped, lobed, or folded, often resembling a pig’s ear or a deformed cup.
  - Textures are fleshy to rubbery when fresh, becoming brittle upon drying.
  - Surfaces are wrinkled or bumpy; colors typically range from brown to reddish-brown or tan.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate, cylindrical, typically containing 8 spores.
  - Ascospores are hyaline, elliptical to fusiform, often with fine ornamentation or surface texture.
  - Paraphyses are well-developed, sometimes slightly pigmented.

**Synapomorphies** include the irregular lobed ascocarp form, fleshy textures, and operculate asci, distinguishing _Discina_ from smoother-cupped genera like _Peziza_.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2) consistently place **Discina** within **Discinaceae**, forming a sister group to _Gyromitra_ and _Hydnotrya_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Discinaceae
 ├── Discina
 ├── Gyromitra
 └── Hydnotrya
```
The genus likely diversified during the Mesozoic, coinciding with the expansion of temperate forest ecosystems where many species are now common.

Recognized notable species include:

- _Discina perlata_ (pig's ear)
- _Discina ancilis_
- _Discina montana_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist, humus-rich soils; forest edges; sometimes post-fire landscapes.
- **Substrates:** Soil, decaying plant matter; rarely directly on wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic material and contributing to forest soil nutrient cycles.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread in North America, Europe, and Asia; primarily in temperate to boreal zones.

Species like _Discina perlata_ often fruit in spring and early summer following snowmelt or seasonal rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Discina** species are occasionally collected for food, although they require proper preparation:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Discina perlata_ is sometimes eaten after thorough cooking, though caution is advised due to its relation to toxic _Gyromitra_ species.
- **Toxicity concerns:**
  - Some sources recommend avoiding consumption entirely because of the potential for toxic compound presence, although _Discina_ is generally considered safer than _Gyromitra_.

**Culinary status** varies by region, with some local traditions valuing
