# Sarcoscyphaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Pezizomycetes › **Order:** Pezizales › **Family:** Sarcoscyphaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sarcoscypha coccinea_ (for the type genus _Sarcoscypha_)  
* **Authority & year:** P. Korf, 1951  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Brightly colored (red, orange) cup fungi, operculate asci, hairy outer surfaces, forest floor saprobes  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Sarcoscyphaceae** was formally established by **Richard P. Korf** in 1951 to accommodate a group of vividly colored cup fungi that were previously placed with other Pezizales based primarily on gross morphology. The name comes from the type genus _Sarcoscypha_, combining Greek _sarco-_ ("flesh") and _scypha_ ("cup"), a direct reference to the fleshy, cup-shaped fruiting bodies typical of the group.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sarcoscyphaceae** members are highly recognizable due to their vibrant pigmentation and surface textures:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Ascocarps are cup-shaped to saucer-shaped.
  - Inner (fertile) surfaces brightly colored—usually scarlet, orange, pink, or red.
  - Outer (sterile) surfaces often whitish, covered in fine hairs or felty textures.
  - Size varies from small (~1–2 cm) to relatively large (~5–8 cm).

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate, cylindrical, and typically contain 8 spores.
  - Ascospores are smooth, hyaline, often ellipsoid to fusiform, sometimes guttulate (containing oil droplets).
  - Paraphyses are common and often pigmented.

**Synapomorphies** include the vividly colored hymenium and the finely hairy or felty exterior surfaces.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2, and other markers) confirm that **Sarcoscyphaceae** is a distinct and strongly supported clade within Pezizales, separate from Pezizaceae and Pyronemataceae.

Key genera include:

- _Sarcoscypha_ (scarlet elf cups)
- _Cookeina_
- _Pithya_
- _Microstoma_

The family likely diverged in the mid-to-late Mesozoic, adapting to forested ecosystems with rich leaf litter and humidity.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist forest floors, along stream banks, on decaying hardwood branches and sticks.
- **Substrates:** Decaying wood, buried twigs, rich humus layers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down woody and organic debris.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan, but especially rich in temperate and tropical regions.

Species like _Sarcoscypha coccinea_ are common across Europe and North America, while _Cookeina_ species dominate in tropical Asia and the Americas.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sarcoscyphaceae** species are widely appreciated for their beauty and ecological role:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Sarcoscypha coccinea_) are reported as edible when cooked, though they are mostly considered too tough or insubstantial for regular consumption.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important decomposers contributing to the breakdown of woody debris and nutrient cycling in forests.
  - Their vivid color can indicate healthy, moist forest ecosystems.

- **Cultural impact:**
  - Their striking appearances have made them favorites in photography, nature literature, and folklore (e.g., often called "elf cups" or "fairy goblets").
