## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sarcosoma globosum_  
* **Authority & year:** Caspary ex P. Karsten, 1869  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Globose to urn-shaped dark fruiting bodies, thick gelatinous flesh, operculate asci, forest floor saprobes  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Sarcosoma** was first formally described by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1869, based on earlier observations by **Johann Caspary**. The name derives from the Greek _sarco-_ ("flesh") and _soma_ ("body"), emphasizing the thick, gelatinous, fleshy nature of these fungi. Originally grouped loosely with various "earth cup" fungi, _Sarcosoma_ has since been clarified through both morphological study and molecular phylogenetic evidence as a key member of the family Sarcosomataceae.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sarcosoma** species are large, distinctive fungi with a robust structure:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are globose, urn-shaped, or somewhat cylindrical.
  - Outer surfaces are dark brown to black, often smooth and shiny when moist.
  - The flesh is thick, gelatinous, and rubbery, especially when fresh.
  - Inner surfaces can range from smooth to wrinkled.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate, thick-walled, and contain 8 ascospores.
  - Ascospores are hyaline to lightly pigmented, ellipsoid to fusiform, smooth-walled.
  - Paraphyses are abundant, often forming a dense hymenial layer.

**Synapomorphies** include the gelatinous consistency of the flesh, globose to urn-shaped morphology, and thick-walled operculate asci.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU) place **Sarcosoma** as a basal and distinct lineage within **Sarcosomataceae**, clearly separated from other genera such as _Galiella_ and _Urnula_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Sarcosomataceae
 ├── Sarcosoma
 ├── Galiella
 ├── Urnula
 └── Donadinia
```
_Sarcosoma_ likely evolved during the Cretaceous or early Paleogene, adapting to cool, moist forest floors in temperate regions.

Recognized notable species include:

- _Sarcosoma globosum_ (type species, "globose earth cup")
- _Sarcosoma latahense_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist, shaded coniferous and mixed forests; favors undisturbed, humus-rich soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil, buried decaying wood, and thick forest litter layers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic material and contributing to nutrient cycling.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily temperate Northern Hemisphere — North America, Europe, East Asia.
  
Some species, such as _S. globosum_, are considered indicators of old-growth forest conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sarcosoma** is of high ecological significance but limited direct economic use:

- **Edibility:** Not considered edible due to tough, gelatinous texture and potential for mild toxicity.
- **Conservation:** 
  - _Sarcosoma globosum_ is listed as near threatened or protected in several European countries due to habitat loss.
  - Sensitive to soil compaction, forestry practices, and changes in moisture regimes.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Plays a vital role in breaking down organic material and maintaining healthy forest soils.
  - Presence often indicates undisturbed, mature forest ecosystems with high conservation value.

Their eerie, dark forms emerging from the forest floor early in the spring have also inspired local folklore and naturalist fascination.
