# Sarcosomataceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Pezizomycetes › **Order:** Pezizales › **Family:** Sarcosomataceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sarcosoma globosum_ (for the type genus _Sarcosoma_)  
* **Authority & year:** Kobayasi, 1937  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Dark, leathery to gelatinous ascocarps, thick-walled operculate asci, saprotrophic in forest litter  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Sarcosomataceae** was formally described by **Yasuyuki Kobayasi** in 1937. The name is derived from the Greek _sarco-_ ("flesh") and _soma_ ("body"), highlighting the fleshy, often gelatinous nature of the fruiting bodies in this group. Originally grouped broadly within Pezizales, Sarcosomataceae was later confirmed as a distinct lineage based on morphological and molecular data, characterized by their dark-colored, robust fruiting structures.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sarcosomataceae** fungi have several characteristic features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are leathery to gelatinous, often black or dark brown.
  - Forms range from cup-like to urn-shaped, globose, or irregularly deformed with age.
  - Flesh is typically thick and rubbery, especially when moist.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate, thick-walled, and cylindrical to slightly clavate.
  - Ascospores are generally smooth, hyaline or lightly pigmented, and often ellipsoid to broadly fusiform.
  - Paraphyses are well-developed and contribute to the thick hymenial layer.

**Synapomorphies** include the dark coloration, tough gelatinous texture, and thick-walled asci, distinguishing them from other Pezizales families.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Sarcosomataceae** as a distinct clade within Pezizales, separate from Pezizaceae and Sarcoscyphaceae.

Key genera include:

- _Sarcosoma_ (globose earth cups)
- _Galiella_
- _Urnula_
- _Donadinia_

The Sarcosomataceae likely diversified during the Cretaceous or early Paleogene, adapting to forest floor ecosystems rich in organic litter.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist, temperate forests; especially in coniferous and mixed woodlands.
- **Substrates:** Soil, buried decaying wood, forest humus.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down wood debris and contributing to nutrient cycling.

- **Geographic range:** Mostly temperate Northern Hemisphere regions — North America, Europe, East Asia; some genera occur in South America and Australasia.

Many species fruit in late winter to spring, often coinciding with snowmelt or seasonal rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sarcosomataceae** fungi are ecologically important but rarely of culinary or economic significance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Most species are considered inedible due to their tough texture and unpalatable consistency.
  - Some species (e.g., _Sarcosoma globosum_) have been traditionally admired but not eaten.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Crucial saprobes for forest soil health, helping decompose organic matter.
  - Indicators of old-growth forest ecosystems and undisturbed habitats.

- **Cultural impact:**
  - _Sarcosoma globosum_ is considered a "flagship" fungal species for conservation in parts of Northern Europe, where it is rare and protected.

These fungi's strange, dark, and sometimes eerie appearance makes them a favorite subject among mushroom enthusiasts and nature photographers.
