# Leotiomycetes <Badge variant="note" text="Class" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Leotiomycetes

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Class  
* **Type species (if applicable):** N/A (Class-level; _Leotia lubrica_ often cited as iconic)  
* **Authority & year:** O.E. Eriksson & Winka, 1997  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Inoperculate asci, soft-textured fruiting bodies (apothecia), wide ecological roles, diverse spore morphologies  

## Discovery & Naming
**Leotiomycetes** was formally defined by **Ove Erik Eriksson and Katarina Winka** in 1997 during a broader effort to restructure the taxonomy of Ascomycota based on emerging molecular data. The name comes from the genus _Leotia_, a distinctive group of jelly-like, cap-and-stipe fungi. Historically, Leotiomycetes members were classified within a loose "Discomycetes" category based on their open, cup-like fruiting bodies, but molecular phylogenetics clearly distinguished this lineage. Major reclassifications followed, separating them from related groups like the Sordariomycetes and Geoglossomycetes.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
Species within **Leotiomycetes** are highly variable, but share several diagnostic traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:** 
  - Typically produce soft, fleshy, often gelatinous apothecia (open fruiting bodies) that can be brightly colored (yellow, green, orange, brown).
  - Some have a stalked (stipitate) morphology resembling small mushrooms, while others are sessile.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are inoperculate (spores are released without a lid mechanism), typically unitunicate.
  - Spores are highly variable—some smooth, others ornamented; many are hyaline (colorless) but others pigmented.
  - Paraphyses are usually well-developed and often pigmented.

**Synapomorphies** include inoperculate asci and the lack of forcible spore discharge found in related operculate groups (e.g., Pezizomycetes).

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses consistently place **Leotiomycetes** within Pezizomycotina. Major internal orders include:

- _Helotiales_ (the largest and most diverse)
- _Rhytismatales_ (plant pathogens and endophytes)
- _Erysiphales_ (powdery mildew fungi)

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

 └── Leotiomycetes
      ├── Helotiales
      ├── Rhytismatales
      └── Erysiphales
```
Leotiomycetes likely diverged from other filamentous ascomycetes in the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic (~300–250 million years ago), with a significant radiation associated with angiosperm evolution.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Highly diverse—woodlands, grasslands, alpine zones, aquatic environments.
- **Substrates:** Soil, decaying wood, living plants (as pathogens or endophytes), even snow and freshwater environments.
- **Trophic modes:** 
  - Saprotrophic (decomposers)
  - Plant pathogenic (e.g., _Botrytis cinerea_, gray mold)
  - Symbiotic (some form endophytic or mutualistic associations)

- **Geographic range:** Global—common in both temperate and tropical ecosystems, with some specialized to extreme environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Leotiomycetes** includes species of major agricultural and economic importance:

- **Pathogens:** 
  - _Botrytis cinerea_ (causes gray mold in grapes, strawberries, and many other crops).
  - _Erysiphales_ species (powdery mildews) are widespread, damaging crops and ornamentals.
- **Beneficial species:** Some are important decomposers or contributors to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.
- **Conservation concerns:** Some helotialean fungi are used as indicators of old-growth forest continuity.

Though few are edible or widely cultivated, the ecological roles of Leotiomycetes fungi are vital for the health of many terrestrial ecosystems.
