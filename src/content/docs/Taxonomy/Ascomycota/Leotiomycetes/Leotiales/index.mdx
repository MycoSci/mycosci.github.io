# Leotiales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Leotiomycetes › **Order:** Leotiales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Leotia lubrica_ (for the type genus _Leotia_)  
* **Authority & year:** Korf, 1973  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gelatinous ascocarps, clavate or capitate forms, inoperculate asci, soft and jelly-like textures  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Leotiales** was proposed by **Richard Paul Korf** in 1973 to accommodate fungi with gelatinous, often mushroom-like ascocarps that did not fit comfortably within Helotiales or other traditional orders of Leotiomycetes. The name is based on the genus _Leotia_, meaning "smooth" in Greek, reflecting the smooth, jelly-like appearance of many species' fruiting bodies. Although its members were historically placed among the "discomycetes," molecular evidence has refined the understanding of Leotiales as a relatively isolated and distinct lineage.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
Members of **Leotiales** are distinctive for their unusual fruiting body morphology:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Soft, gelatinous, capitate or club-shaped ascocarps.
  - Often brightly colored—yellow, green, orange.
  - A cap-and-stipe architecture is present in most species, somewhat resembling small agarics (gilled mushrooms) but without true gills.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Inoperculate, unitunicate asci.
  - Ascospores are typically smooth, hyaline (colorless), and may be multinucleate.
  - Hymenial elements embedded in a gelatinous matrix.

**Synapomorphies** include the jelly-like consistency and the development of a cap and stem structure in the ascocarps—unusual among other members of the Leotiomycetes.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Although initially grouped morphologically with Helotiales, molecular phylogenetics (based on ITS, LSU, RPB2 sequences) support **Leotiales** as a distinct lineage within Leotiomycetes.

Key genera within Leotiales include:

- _Leotia_ (e.g., _Leotia lubrica_, "jelly babies")
- _Microglossum_ (closely related, but sometimes placed elsewhere based on newer molecular data)

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

Leotiomycetes
 ├── Helotiales
 ├── Rhytismatales
 ├── Erysiphales
 └── Leotiales
      └── Leotia
```
Leotiales likely diverged during the late Mesozoic to early Cenozoic (~100–60 million years ago), representing an independent adaptation to moist, often forested environments.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist forests, mossy areas, humid soil environments.
- **Substrates:** Soil, decaying organic matter, occasionally associated with mosses or forest litter.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic; decomposing organic debris and contributing to soil nutrient cycles.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan, with species recorded in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia, especially common in temperate and montane forests.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
Species of **Leotiales**, particularly _Leotia lubrica_, are well-known among naturalists and foragers due to their unusual jelly-like appearance. They are generally considered **non-toxic** but **inedible** because of their unappealing texture.

While they have no significant direct economic impact, they are valuable components of forest floor ecosystems, aiding in nutrient recycling and soil health.

Their unique form has also made them favorites in popular mushroom identification guides and fungal photography.
