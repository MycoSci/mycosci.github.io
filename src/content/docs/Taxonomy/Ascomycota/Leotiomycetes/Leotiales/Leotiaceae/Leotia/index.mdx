## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Leotia lubrica_  
* **Authority & year:** Persoon, 1794  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Jelly babies, gelatinous cap-and-stipe ascocarps, smooth hymenium, inoperculate asci  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Leotia** was first described by **Christiaan Hendrik Persoon** in 1794. Its name derives from the Greek word *leios* (λείος), meaning "smooth," in reference to the glossy, slippery texture of the fruiting bodies. _Leotia_ species were long classified among the "Discomycetes" but distinguished by their peculiar cap-and-stipe structure and gelatinous consistency. Molecular phylogenetic studies later validated _Leotia_ as a distinct lineage within the Leotiaceae.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Leotia** species are easily recognized in the field by their unique appearance:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Small, cap-and-stipe fungi, typically 2–10 cm tall.
  - Caps are gelatinous, smooth, and lobed or folded; often greenish, yellow, or brownish.
  - Stipes are rubbery or flexible, sometimes paler than the cap.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Inoperculate, unitunicate asci containing 8 ascospores.
  - Spores are hyaline (colorless), ellipsoid to fusiform, and smooth-walled.
  - Paraphyses abundant, embedded within a gelatinous matrix.

**Synapomorphies** for _Leotia_ include gelatinous, lobed caps atop flexible stalks, and the production of smooth, hyaline spores within inoperculate asci.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2) consistently place _Leotia_ within **Leotiaceae**, forming a distinct, monophyletic clade. 

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

Leotiaceae
 └── Leotia

The genus likely diverged during the late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic (~70–50 million years ago) and has since diversified primarily in moist forested environments.

Recognized species include:

- _Leotia lubrica_ (common "jelly baby")
- _Leotia atrovirens_ (darker forms)
- _Leotia viscosa_ (yellow-green species)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist, shaded woodlands; mossy or humus-rich forest floors.
- **Substrates:** Soil and decaying plant material, particularly in humid environments.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, contributing to the decomposition of organic debris.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across temperate zones of North America, Europe, and Asia; also recorded in parts of Australasia and South America.

Species of _Leotia_ often appear in late summer to autumn, coinciding with moist soil conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
While not commercially significant, **_Leotia_** species are beloved by mushroom enthusiasts for their distinctive, colorful, and gelatinous appearance.

- **Edibility:** Generally considered inedible—not due to toxicity, but because of their rubbery, unpalatable texture.
- **Cultural role:** Frequently featured in fungal field guides and nature photography under the nickname "jelly babies."

Although they do not have major ecological dominance, they play important roles in forest soil health and biodiversity.
