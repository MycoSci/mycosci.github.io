# Sclerotiniaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Leotiomycetes › **Order:** Helotiales › **Family:** Sclerotiniaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sclerotinia libertiana_ (= _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_)  
* **Authority & year:** Whetzel, 1945  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Plant pathogens, production of sclerotia, soft apothecia, wide host range, necrotrophic life strategy  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Sclerotiniaceae** was established by **Herbert Hice Whetzel** in 1945. The name derives from the genus _Sclerotinia_, itself named for the hard, resting structures (sclerotia) produced by many species. These hardened survival structures enable the fungi to endure adverse conditions. Early taxonomic work grouped many of these pathogens with general cup fungi, but their biological distinctiveness, especially in terms of ecology and pathogenicity, justified family status.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sclerotiniaceae** members share several defining morphological traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Typically form soft, delicate, stalked apothecia.
  - Fruiting bodies arise from sclerotia after a period of dormancy.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Inoperculate, unitunicate asci containing 8 ascospores.
  - Spores usually hyaline (colorless), smooth, and aseptate or few-septate.
  - Well-developed paraphyses, often forming a gelatinous layer.

**Synapomorphies** include the production of sclerotia and the association with plant pathogenic lifestyles.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2, and other genes) position **Sclerotiniaceae** firmly within **Helotiales**. Key genera within the family include:

- _Sclerotinia_ (e.g., _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_)
- _Monilinia_ (responsible for brown rot in stone fruits)
- _Botrytis_ (e.g., _Botrytis cinerea_, gray mold)

**Simple text cladogram:**
```
Sclerotiniaceae
 ├── Sclerotinia
 ├── Botrytis
 └── Monilinia
```
Estimates suggest the Sclerotiniaceae arose during the Cretaceous to early Paleogene periods, contemporaneous with the diversification of flowering plants, many of which serve as hosts.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Agricultural fields, forests, grasslands; any environment where host plants are present.
- **Substrates:** Living plants (pathogens), dead plant material (saprotrophs).
- **Trophic modes:** 
  - Primarily necrotrophic plant pathogens (killing host tissue).
  - Some species have saprotrophic phases on decaying matter.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan—occurring on all continents, including temperate, tropical, and even alpine regions.

Species are known for infecting a wide range of host plants, sometimes leading to significant economic losses in agriculture and horticulture.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sclerotiniaceae** fungi are among the most economically significant plant pathogens worldwide:

- **Major pathogens:**
  - _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ affects over 400 plant species, causing white mold on crops like soybeans, sunflowers, and canola.
  - _Botrytis cinerea_ causes gray mold on grapes, strawberries, tomatoes, and many ornamentals.
  - _Monilinia fructicola_ and relatives cause devastating brown rot in stone fruits like peaches and cherries.

- **Positive aspects:** 
  - _Botrytis cinerea_ is also used beneficially in winemaking for producing "noble rot" wines (e.g., Sauternes).

Control of these fungi often requires integrated management strategies combining chemical, biological, and cultural practices.

Conservation is less a concern for the family, although understanding their biology is crucial for managing crop diseases in a changing climate.
