## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sclerotinia libertiana_ (= _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_)  
* **Authority & year:** Fuckel, 1870  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Plant pathogenic fungi, production of sclerotia, soft white apothecia, necrotrophic lifestyle  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Sclerotinia** was described by the German mycologist **Karl Wilhelm Gottlieb Leopold Fuckel** in 1870. The name _Sclerotinia_ reflects the genus’s most distinctive feature: the formation of **sclerotia**—hard, durable resting structures that allow the fungi to survive adverse environmental conditions. Early studies grouped _Sclerotinia_ species with general cup fungi, but later research recognized their specialized biology and major impact on agriculture, justifying separate genus-level status.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sclerotinia** species share consistent morphological traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Soft, fragile, small to medium-sized apothecia (fruiting bodies) that are often white to pale cream.
  - Fruiting bodies typically arise from overwintered sclerotia.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are inoperculate, cylindrical, and unitunicate, producing 8 hyaline (colorless) ascospores.
  - Spores are generally smooth and elliptical.
  - Paraphyses are present and contribute to the gelatinous consistency of the hymenium.

**Synapomorphies** include the consistent production of sclerotia and the development of apothecia directly from these structures.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Within **Sclerotiniaceae**, molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2, and others) support **Sclerotinia** as a monophyletic genus, closely related to _Botrytis_ and _Monilinia_.

**Simple text cladogram:**
```
Sclerotiniaceae
 ├── Botrytis
 ├── Monilinia
 └── Sclerotinia
```
Fossil-calibrated phylogenies suggest that _Sclerotinia_ evolved during the late Cretaceous to early Paleogene, roughly 80–60 million years ago, likely in parallel with the expansion of broadleaf flowering plants.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Fields, gardens, forests—anywhere host plants are present.
- **Substrates:** Living plant tissues (as pathogens); dead organic matter after host death.
- **Trophic modes:** 
  - Primarily necrotrophic (killing host tissues and feeding on the dead material).
  - Capable of long-term saprotrophic survival via sclerotia.

- **Geographic range:** Global distribution, with major impacts in temperate, subtropical, and cool tropical regions.

_Sclerotinia_ species can infect a wide range of plant hosts, making them major players in both wild ecosystems and agricultural systems.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sclerotinia** includes some of the most devastating pathogens in agriculture:

- **Major species:**
  - _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ causes white mold on soybeans, sunflowers, canola, peas, and many vegetable crops.
  - _Sclerotinia minor_ and _Sclerotinia trifoliorum_ affect lettuce, peanuts, clovers, and other legumes.

- **Economic impact:** Annual crop losses due to _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ alone are estimated in the billions of dollars globally.

- **Control methods:** Integrated disease management strategies include crop rotation, resistant cultivars, biological control (e.g., _Coniothyrium minitans_), and chemical fungicides.

Despite their notoriety as pathogens, understanding the resilience mechanisms of _Sclerotinia_ (especially sclerotia formation) is providing insights into fungal ecology, stress tolerance, and long-term survival strategies.
