# Helotiales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Leotiomycetes › **Order:** Helotiales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Helotium aurantiacum_ (for the type genus _Helotium_)  
* **Authority & year:** Nannfeldt, 1932  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Inoperculate asci, cup- or disc-shaped fruiting bodies (apothecia), saprotrophic or biotrophic, diverse habitats  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Helotiales** was first established by **John Axel Nannfeldt** in 1932 during his work on the taxonomy of the inoperculate Discomycetes. The name is derived from the type genus _Helotium_, itself rooted in the Greek word *helos* (ἕλος), meaning "marsh"—a reference to the moist environments where many helotialean fungi are found. Early taxonomic concepts were largely morphology-based, but with molecular phylogenetic advances in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Helotiales has been redefined and expanded to include an exceptionally broad range of lineages.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
Given its large size and ecological breadth, Helotiales is morphologically diverse, but key unifying traits include:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Typically small to medium-sized, soft, fleshy, often brightly colored apothecia.
  - Apothecia may be sessile or stalked, with a smooth to slightly wrinkled upper surface.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Inoperculate, unitunicate asci (spores released without a lid mechanism).
  - Ascospores typically small, hyaline (colorless) or lightly pigmented, and may be septate or non-septate.
  - Paraphyses present, often forming a gelatinous hymenium.

**Synapomorphies**: The lack of an operculum in the ascus and predominantly small, cup-like fruiting bodies set Helotiales apart from other Leotiomycetes orders.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Phylogenetic studies using multigene datasets (ITS, LSU, RPB2, TEF1-α) reveal that **Helotiales** is a highly diverse and paraphyletic group, suggesting it might eventually be split into multiple smaller orders.

Key families within Helotiales include:

- _Helotiaceae_ (type family)
- _Dermateaceae_
- _Hyaloscyphaceae_
- _Sclerotiniaceae_ (includes many plant pathogens)

**Simple text cladogram:**

Leotiomycetes
 ├── Rhytismatales

      ├── Helotiaceae
      ├── Dermateaceae
      ├── Hyaloscyphaceae
      └── Sclerotiniaceae
```
Divergence estimates suggest Helotiales originated during the Jurassic or early Cretaceous (~150–100 million years ago), contemporaneous with the diversification of angiosperms (flowering plants), with which many species have close ecological relationships.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Widespread in woodlands, grasslands, alpine tundras, marshes, and aquatic habitats.
- **Substrates:** Soil, decaying wood, plant debris, living plant tissues (pathogenic forms), lichens, mosses.
- **Trophic modes:**
  - Saprotrophic (decomposers of leaf litter, wood, and other organic matter).
  - Biotrophic or necrotrophic plant pathogens (e.g., _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ on crops).
  - Endophytic or symbiotic in some cases.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan, from arctic tundra to tropical rainforests.

Helotiales fungi are crucial players in nutrient recycling, forest soil health, and the dynamics of plant disease.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
Helotiales includes species of major agricultural concern:

- **Pathogens:** 
  - _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ and _Botrytis cinerea_ cause destructive plant diseases, particularly affecting oilseeds, vegetables, grapes, and ornamentals.
- **Beneficial roles:** Some species are important saprobes that enhance soil fertility.
- **Conservation aspects:** Some species in Helotiales are indicators of old-growth forests or undisturbed soil ecosystems and are of interest in conservation biology.

Though few Helotiales fungi are consumed or cultivated for food, their importance in ecosystem functioning and crop health is immense.
