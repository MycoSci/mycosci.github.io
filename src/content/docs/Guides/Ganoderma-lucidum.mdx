## 2. Discovery & Naming

The species *Ganoderma lucidum* was first described in Western science by English botanist William Curtis in 1781 as *Boletus lucidus*​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma_lucidum#:~:text=The%20history%20of%20the%20Ganoderma,6). It was later reclassified by Elias Fries in 1821 as *Polyporus lucidus*, before Finnish mycologist Petter Adolf Karsten established the genus *Ganoderma* in 1881 with *G. lucidum* (Curtis) P. Karst. as the type species​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma_lucidum#:~:text=The%20history%20of%20the%20Ganoderma,6). The genus name *Ganoderma* derives from Greek *ganos* (brightness, sheen) and *derma* (skin), and the species epithet *lucidum* comes from Latin *lucidus* meaning "shining" or "brilliant" -- referring to the varnished appearance of the fruiting body​[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92757/#:~:text=Ganoderma%20lucidum%2C%20an%20oriental%20fungus,family%20is%20reishi%20or%20mannentake)​[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92757/#:~:text=The%20proliferation%20of%20G,holy%20farmer%E2%80%9D%3B%20%2023%20Zhu).

Historically, *G. lucidum* has a long record of use in East Asia, being revered in China, Japan, and Korea for over two millennia​[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92757/#:~:text=Lingzhi%20has%20been%20recognized%20as,and%20was%20composed%20in%20the). It appears in the oldest Chinese herbal texts such as the *Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing* (Eastern Han dynasty, ~1st--2nd century AD) and was classified as a superior herbal medicine believed to promote longevity​[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92757/#:~:text=women%E2%80%99s%20accessories%20%28Wasser%202005%20%29,536%20AD%29%20and%20the%20Ben)​[nissankenko.com](https://www.nissankenko.com/eng/about/#:~:text=considered%20supreme%20as%20a%20good,mushroom%20variety%20that%20promoted%20health). In Japan, it was documented in the *Nihon Shoki* (720 AD) and known as "Mannentake" (10,000-year mushroom), indicating its perceived health benefits and rarity​[nissankenko.com](https://www.nissankenko.com/eng/about/#:~:text=reishi%20is%20allocated%20to%20the,mushroom%20variety%20that%20promoted%20health). Culturally, the mushroom was so rare in the wild that it was historically reserved for royalty and nobility; legends claimed it grew in the abodes of immortals, contributing to its aura as an elixir of immortality​[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92757/#:~:text=Wild%20lingzhi%20is%20rare%2C%20and,Lindequist%2C%20Niedermeyer%2C%20and%20J%C3%BClich%202005).

**Taxonomic Confusion:** The name *Ganoderma lucidum* has been applied broadly to many similar "reishi" mushrooms around the world, causing significant confusion in mycology​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma_lucidum#:~:text=Despite%20this%20recognition%20of%20additional,same%20clade%3A%20based%20on%20molecular). Modern taxonomy recognizes that the true *G. lucidum* (sensu stricto), originally from Europe, is distinct from the Asian species used in traditional medicine​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma_lucidum#:~:text=and%20the%20species%20name%20Ganoderma,1). Notably, the famed red reishi of China and Japan is now identified as *Ganoderma lingzhi* (synonym *G. sichuanense*), which is **not** a synonym of *G. lucidum* and belongs to a different genetic clade​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma_lucidum#:~:text=and%20the%20species%20name%20Ganoderma,1). Phylogenetic studies show *G. lucidum* is more closely related to North American species like *G. tsugae* (hemlock reishi) and *G. oregonense* than to *G. lingzhi*​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma_lucidum#:~:text=%28China%29%29%2C%20the%20sought,1). For example, a 2015 molecular phylogeny identified three major lineages of Ganoderma globally, separating the European *G. lucidum* lineage from the Asian *G. lingzhi* lineage and others​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma_lucidum#:~:text=A%202015%20phylogeny%20study%20revealed,11). This clarification means that many commercial "*G. lucidum*" products, especially those cultivated in Asia, are actually *G. lingzhi*​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma_lucidum#:~:text=and%20the%20species%20name%20Ganoderma,Ganoderma%20oregonense%20than%20to%20G). Nonetheless, the historical name "*Ganoderma lucidum*" continues to be used in literature and commerce as an umbrella term for the **Reishi/Lingzhi** mushrooms.

## 13. Conservation Status

- **IUCN:** Not Evaluated  
- **Regional Status:** Uncommon in wild; listed as rare in some European Red Lists (Belarus, Finland)  
- **Threats:** Habitat loss (removal of dead wood), forestry practices  
- **Population Trend:** Stable in cultivation; declining in unmanaged wild  
- **Actions:** Protect deadwood in forests; fungal biodiversity programs  

## 14. Field Identification Rubric

<Steps>
1. Verify growth on decaying **hardwood** (oak, maple)—exclude conifer hosts.  
2. Inspect cap: **shiny** reddish-brown with white margin, 5–15 cm, **varnished** surface.  
3. Check pores: **white** surface, ~4–5 pores/mm; collect **brown spore print** overnight.  
4. Confirm **woody corky flesh** without dark bands; note presence of lateral stem.  
</Steps>

<Aside type="note" title="Diagnostic Summary">
  Shiny red-brown varnished cap, white decurrent pores, brown spore print on hardwood substrate = **Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum sensu lato)**.
