Welcome to **MycoSci**, your free, open-source hub dedicated to the science, cultivation, and exploration of mushrooms. Whether you're a seasoned mycologist, a passionate cultivator, or simply fungi-curious, you've come to the right place.

Our docs are organized scientifically, practically, and intuitively, helping you navigate from detailed species references to hands-on cultivation techniques and field guides.

If you're looking for a deep dive into classification, start in the [Taxonomy section](../Taxonomy/).

## How to Navigate the Docs

### 📖 **Taxonomy (Scientific Reference)**
Explore mushrooms through a structured scientific hierarchy:
- **Kingdom → Phylum → Class → Order → Family → Genus → Species**  
Every species page provides detailed identification information, genetics insights, chemistry, and practical notes.

**Example:**  
[Basidiomycota → Agaricomycetes → Agaricales → Agaricaceae → Agaricus → Agaricus bisporus](../taxonomy/basidiomycota/agaricomycetes/agaricales/agaricaceae/agaricus/agaricus_bisporus/intro)

---

### 🌱 **Cultivation Methods**
Learn mushroom cultivation techniques, from beginner-friendly monotubs and PF-Tek jars to advanced sterile lab practices and agar cultures.

Check out the [Cultivation Section](../cultivation/beginner/pf-tek) to start your mushroom-growing journey.
