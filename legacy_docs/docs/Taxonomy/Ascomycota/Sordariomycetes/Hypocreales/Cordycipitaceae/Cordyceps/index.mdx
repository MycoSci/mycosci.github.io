## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Cordyceps militaris_  
* **Authority & year:** Fr. (Elias Magnus Fries), 1818  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Parasitic on insects and arthropods, brightly colored stromata (orange, yellow, red), operculate asci, filamentous ascospores  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Cordyceps** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1818. The name comes from Greek roots _kordyle_ ("club") and _ceps_ ("head"), referring to the club-like appearance of their fruiting bodies. Known for centuries in traditional Asian medicine and folklore, _Cordyceps_ has fascinated both scientists and the public, inspiring cultural myths and modern biomedical research. Modern phylogenetics has refined the genus, separating many former _Cordyceps_ species into new or related genera (_Ophiocordyceps_, _Metacordyceps_, etc.).

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Cordyceps** species exhibit highly distinctive and fascinating traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies (stromata) are usually bright orange, yellow, red, or pink.
  - Stromata arise directly from the bodies of parasitized insects or spiders.
  - Forms include simple clubs, branched structures, or more complex, intricate forms.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are cylindrical, unitunicate, and have an operculum through which spores are discharged.
  - Ascospores are long, slender, hyaline, and often fragment into multiple part-spores (secondary spores).
  - Paraphyses are present, aiding in the discharge process.

**Synapomorphies** include the parasitic habit, club-like fruiting structures, and thread-like ascospores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2, TEF1-α) show that **Cordyceps** (sensu stricto) is now limited to species infecting primarily insects (notably larvae of moths and beetles) and is phylogenetically distinct from _Ophiocordyceps_ (which infects ants and other hosts).

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Cordycipitaceae
 ├── Cordyceps
 ├── Beauveria
 ├── Akanthomyces
 └── Isaria
```
The diversification of _Cordyceps_ likely began during the Cretaceous, correlating with the radiation of insect hosts.

Recognized notable species include:

- _Cordyceps militaris_ (bright orange club fungus)
- _Cordyceps pruinosa_
- _Cordyceps cicadae_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Humid forests, leaf litter, mossy logs, soil surfaces rich in insect hosts.
- **Substrates:** Insects (particularly Lepidoptera larvae, beetles, flies) and, more rarely, arachnids.
- **Trophic modes:** Obligate parasitic, with eventual death of the host and consumption of its tissues.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread across temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions — particularly abundant in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South America.

Fruiting is often seasonal, appearing after rainy periods when insect populations surge.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Cordyceps** holds major cultural, medicinal, and economic importance:

- **Medicinal uses:**
  - _Cordyceps militaris_ is cultivated and used for its bioactive compounds, including cordycepin and polysaccharides with potential anti-cancer, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory effects.
  - Traditionally prized in Chinese medicine for enhancing vitality and endurance.

- **Commercial cultivation:**
  - _C. militaris_ is widely cultivated on artificial media for supplements and medicinal products.
  - Wild collection of related species remains important in parts of Asia.

- **Cultural significance:**
  - _Cordyceps_ fungi are symbols of vitality and longevity in East Asian cultures.
  - Popularized in modern media, inspiring depictions of parasitic fungi with zombie-like effects on insects (and fictional extrapolations).

- **Conservation:** 
  - Some wild species (especially those in high-altitude Asian regions) are under threat from overharvesting and climate change.

The genus continues to be a hotspot for scientific discovery and public fascination.
