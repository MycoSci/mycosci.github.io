## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sarcoscypha coccinea_  
* **Authority & year:** Boudier, 1885  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Scarlet elf cups, bright red inner surface, cup-shaped fruiting bodies, hairy or felty outer surface, operculate asci  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Sarcoscypha** was formally described by **Jean Louis Émile Boudier** in 1885. The name combines the Greek _sarco-_ ("flesh") and _scypha_ ("cup"), referring to the thick, fleshy, cup-like fruiting bodies of its species. _Sarcoscypha_ was distinguished from other Pezizales fungi by its vivid coloration and felty outer surface, characteristics later confirmed as phylogenetically significant by molecular studies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sarcoscypha** species are among the most striking fungi in temperate woodlands:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Ascocarps are cup- or goblet-shaped, ranging from 2–8 cm across.
  - Inner surfaces are vividly colored — bright red, scarlet, or orange.
  - Outer surfaces are pale, often covered in fine white to grayish hairs.
  - Flesh is firm, rubbery when fresh, becoming brittle when dry.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate, cylindrical, unitunicate, with active spore discharge.
  - Ascospores are smooth, hyaline, elliptical, often containing guttules (oil droplets).
  - Paraphyses are abundant, contributing to the colored hymenium.

**Synapomorphies** include the vivid inner hymenial coloration, hairy outer texture, and elliptical, guttulate spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, and RPB2) place **Sarcoscypha** firmly within the Sarcoscyphaceae as a distinct genus, separate from related tropical genera like _Cookeina_.

_Sarcoscypha_ likely diverged during the late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic (~70–50 million years ago), adapting to cool, moist forest floors.

Recognized important species include:

- _Sarcoscypha coccinea_ (scarlet elf cup)
- _Sarcoscypha austriaca_
- _Sarcoscypha dudleyi_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist woodlands, especially along streams, riverbanks, and shaded forest floors.
- **Substrates:** Decaying twigs, branches, and rich humus layers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing wood and organic matter.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread across temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia; some species adapted to subtropical and montane habitats.

Fruiting typically occurs in late winter to early spring, often appearing as some of the first fungi of the season.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sarcoscypha** is beloved for its ecological and aesthetic value:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _S. coccinea_) are reported as edible when cooked, but they are generally not sought after for culinary purposes due to their small size and rubbery texture.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Vital decomposers in forest ecosystems, promoting the recycling of woody debris.
  - Indicators of healthy, moist forest environments.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Their vibrant red cups have earned names like "elf cups" and "fairy goblets" in folklore and mushroom lore.
  - Popular subjects in mushroom photography and nature study.
