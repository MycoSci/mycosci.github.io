# Pezizales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Ascomycota › **Class:** Pezizomycetes › **Order:** Pezizales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Peziza vesiculosa_ (for the type genus _Peziza_)  
* **Authority & year:** Dumortier, 1829  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Cup fungi, operculate asci, fleshy to brittle apothecia, saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal lifestyles  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Pezizales** was established by **Barthélemy Charles Joseph Dumortier** in 1829. The name is derived from the genus _Peziza_, one of the most widespread and recognizable genera of cup fungi. Early classifications grouped a broad variety of open, cup-shaped ascomycetes together; however, Pezizales became a refined, more narrowly circumscribed order through molecular phylogenetic studies in the late 20th century, which confirmed the operculate ascus as a defining feature.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Pezizales** fungi exhibit distinctive characteristics:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies (apothecia) range from shallow cups to deeply lobed or saddle-shaped structures.
  - Textures vary from gelatinous to brittle and leathery.
  - Colors can be bright (orange, yellow, violet) or subdued (brown, black).

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Asci are operculate (opening by a lid to release spores).
  - Ascospores vary greatly in shape, size, and ornamentation but are typically forcibly discharged.
  - Paraphyses are usually well-developed and often contribute to the coloration of the hymenium.

**Synapomorphies** include the combination of operculate asci and fleshy or brittle, open apothecia adapted for spore dispersal via air currents.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Multigene molecular phylogenetic analyses (using ITS, LSU, RPB2, EF1-α, and β-tubulin) robustly support **Pezizales** as a monophyletic group within the **Pezizomycetes**.

Major families within Pezizales include:

- _Pezizaceae_ (classic cup fungi, _Peziza_ spp.)
- _Morchellaceae_ (morels, _Morchella_ spp.)
- _Tuberaceae_ (truffles, _Tuber_ spp.)
- _Ascobolaceae_ (coprophilous fungi, e.g., _Ascobolus_ spp.)
- _Pyronemataceae_ (highly diverse group, includes many brightly colored soil fungi)

Fossil and molecular evidence suggest Pezizales emerged during the early Mesozoic (~250–200 million years ago), with major radiations coinciding with the diversification of flowering plants.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** 
  - Forest soils, grasslands, deserts, alpine meadows, post-fire environments, and dung.
- **Substrates:** 
  - Soil, charred wood, dung, leaf litter, sometimes ectomycorrhizal with plant roots.
- **Trophic modes:**
  - Saprotrophic (decomposing organic matter and promoting soil health).
  - Ectomycorrhizal (symbiotic with trees, especially truffles).
  - Coprophilous (growing on dung, promoting nutrient recycling).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; Pezizales species are found worldwide, from tropical to arctic biomes.

Some species are ecological specialists of disturbed or extreme environments, like post-wildfire landscapes.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
Many Pezizales fungi have important cultural, culinary, and economic roles:

- **Edible and prized species:**
  - _Morchella_ spp. (morels) — highly sought after for their flavor and culinary value.
  - _Tuber_ spp. (truffles) — luxury food items, integral to European haute cuisine.
- **Toxic species:**
  - Some species of _Gyromitra_ (false morels) are toxic if improperly prepared, producing monomethylhydrazine (MMH).
- **Ecological importance:**
  - Fire-adapted species like _Peziza domiciliana_ and _Geopyxis carbonaria_ colonize burned soils, aiding in ecological recovery.
  - Ectomycorrhizal species like truffles play key roles in nutrient exchange between trees and soil.

Economically, the truffle industry alone is worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
