# Pseudocolus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Phallales › **Family:** Phallaceae › **Genus:** Pseudocolus

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Pseudocolus fusiformis_  
* **Authority & year:** Lloyd, 1907  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small stinkhorns with three or four arms, slimy gleba at the top, bright colors (orange, red), saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Pseudocolus** was described by **Curtis Gates Lloyd** in 1907. The name combines _pseudo-_ ("false") and _Colus_ (another stinkhorn genus), highlighting the resemblance to _Colus_ but with distinct morphological differences.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Pseudocolus** species are delicate and visually striking stinkhorns:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies develop from a gelatinous "egg" and expand into a small upright structure with three or four slender arms.
  - Arms are brightly colored (orange, pink, red) and converge at the top.
  - Slimy gleba containing the spores is concentrated near the apex of the arms.
  - Entire structure is hollow and spongy.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include slender upright arms, apex-concentrated gleba, and bright coloration adapted for insect attraction.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Pseudocolus** within the Phallaceae family, related to genera like _Clathrus_ and _Lysurus_, but distinguished by its small, simple, multi-armed structure.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Phallaceae
 ├── Phallus
 ├── Clathrus
 ├── Lysurus
 └── Pseudocolus
```
The genus likely evolved specialized adaptations for saprotrophic lifestyles in rich soil environments.

Important species:

- _Pseudocolus fusiformis_ (the stinkhorn of small gardens)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Gardens, mulch, lawns, tropical forests, disturbed sites.
- **Substrates:** Rich organic soils, compost piles, decaying wood chips.

- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down dead organic matter.

- **Geographic range:** Found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide; introduced in temperate regions through mulch and plant trade.

Species typically fruit during wet seasons, appearing rapidly after heavy rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Pseudocolus** fungi are charming oddities of the fungal world:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not considered edible; slimy texture and strong odor make them unappealing.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Contribute to decomposition and soil enrichment.
  - Attract flies and beetles that help disperse spores over wide areas.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Their strange, colorful forms and rapid appearance make them popular among nature photographers and mushroom enthusiasts.

Their bizarre beauty, important decomposer role, and surprising appearances after rainstorms make _Pseudocolus_ a memorable genus in Phallales.
