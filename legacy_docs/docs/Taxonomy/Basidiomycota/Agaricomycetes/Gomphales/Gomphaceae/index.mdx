# Gomphaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Gomphales › **Family:** Gomphaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Gomphus clavatus_ (for the type genus _Gomphus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Jülich, 1981  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Coral-like, funnel-shaped, or brain-like fruitbodies, dry textures, wrinkled to smooth hymenophores, saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Gomphaceae** was established by **Walter Jülich** in 1981 based on the recognition that many large coral-like and cup-like fungi were distinct from true coral fungi (_Clavariaceae_). It is named after the type genus _Gomphus_, which refers to the nail- or peg-like shape of some species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Gomphaceae** fungi vary greatly in shape but share several structural traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are often funnel-shaped, coral-like, lobed, or brain-like in appearance.
  - Hymenophores are smooth, wrinkled, or slightly veined, but never true gills.
  - Surfaces are typically dry and velvety to finely scaly.
  - Colors range from pale creams to vivid oranges, purples, and pinks.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth to ornamented, hyaline to slightly yellow-brown.
  - Clamp connections are variably present.

**Synapomorphies** include dry, irregularly wrinkled hymenophores, non-gilled structures, and ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic habits.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Gomphaceae** securely within the Gomphales, distinct from coral fungi of the Clavariaceae and Cantharellales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Gomphales
 ├── Clavariadelphaceae
 └── Gomphaceae
      └── Gomphus and relatives
```
The family likely diversified in forested ecosystems, exploring multiple nutrient acquisition strategies (saprotrophy and mycorrhizal symbiosis).

Major genera:

- _Gomphus_ (type genus)
- _Ramaria_ (some species historically included but now often placed separately)
- _Phaeoclavulina_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors in temperate and tropical forests; among moss, leaf litter, or organic soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil and humus; occasionally rotting wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal, depending on species.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; abundant in Northern Hemisphere temperate forests and tropical rainforests.

Species typically fruit during moist seasons, often in dense clusters or scattered troops.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Gomphaceae** fungi are ecologically important and sometimes gathered for food:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Gomphus clavatus_) are edible when young, but others can cause gastrointestinal upset if consumed in large quantities or improperly prepared.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important decomposers and symbionts in forest ecosystems, aiding nutrient cycling and forest soil health.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Valuable for studies of fungal evolution, particularly the transitions from coral to cup-like forms and the emergence of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.

Their sculptural beauty, ecological versatility, and evolutionary significance make _Gomphaceae_ one of the most intriguing families among fungi.
