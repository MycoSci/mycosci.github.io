**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Thelephorales › **Family:** Bankeraceae › **Genus:** Sarcodon

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Sarcodon imbricatus_  
* **Authority & year:** P. Karst., 1881  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Large toothed fungi, tough fleshy textures, scaly caps, dark ornamented spores, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Sarcodon** was described by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1881. The name derives from Greek _sarx_ ("flesh") and _odon_ ("tooth"), referring to the fleshy nature and spiny, toothed undersurfaces of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Sarcodon** species are robust and distinctive among forest fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are mushroom-shaped, with centrally positioned stipes and large, convex to flattened caps.
  - Caps are often rough or covered with overlapping scales; colors vary from gray, brown, olive, to dark purple.
  - Undersurfaces have coarse, prominent spines (teeth) pointing downward.
  - Flesh is thick, tough, and often emits strong, earthy or resinous odors.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are ornamented, brown in mass, and echinulate (spiny).
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include spiny hymenophores, scaly caps, dark spore masses, and tough textures.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Sarcodon** within the Bankeraceae of Thelephorales, close to _Hydnellum_ and _Phellodon_, but often distinguished by larger fruitbodies and thicker spines.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

The genus represents a highly specialized lineage adapted to ectomycorrhizal relationships in conifer-dominated forests.

Important species include:

- _Sarcodon imbricatus_ (hawk’s wing fungus)
- _Sarcodon scabrosus_
- _Sarcodon squamosus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous forests; mossy or acidic soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil and humus layers rich in organic matter, in close association with tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Strictly ectomycorrhizal, partnering mainly with pine, spruce, and fir.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across temperate and boreal forests of North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species typically fruit from late summer into autumn, especially following rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Sarcodon** fungi are ecologically vital and culturally interesting:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Sarcodon imbricatus_) are edible when young, though many develop bitterness with age.
  - Traditionally used for food and dye production (gray to blue dyes) in parts of Europe.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical mycorrhizal partners supporting tree health and forest ecosystem functioning.
  - Indicators of ancient or undisturbed forest habitats.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Many _Sarcodon_ species are considered rare or threatened in Europe and are protected due to forest degradation.

Their scaly, rugged beauty, deep ecological roles, and traditional uses make _Sarcodon_ an essential genus among ectomycorrhizal fungi.
