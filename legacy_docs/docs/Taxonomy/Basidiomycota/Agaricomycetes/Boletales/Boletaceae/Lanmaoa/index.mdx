# Lanmaoa <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Boletales › **Family:** Boletaceae › **Genus:** Lanmaoa

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lanmaoa asiatica_  
* **Authority & year:** G. Wu, Halling & Zhu L. Yang, 2015  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium to large boletes, colorful caps (red, yellow, brown), yellow pores, brown spore prints, often blue-staining, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Lanmaoa** was described by **Gang Wu**, **Roy Halling**, and **Zhu L. Yang** in 2015 following molecular studies that clarified relationships within Boletaceae. The name honors **Lan Mao**, a 14th-century Chinese herbalist, recognizing the genus's distribution primarily in Asia.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lanmaoa** species share vibrant colors and typical bolete forms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly convex, dry to slightly sticky, often red, yellow, brownish, or multicolored.
  - Pore surfaces are yellow to orange, frequently bruising blue when handled.
  - Stipes are stout, often slightly reticulate near the apex and colored to match or contrast the cap.
  - Spore prints are olive-brown to brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, brown in deposit, ellipsoid to subfusiform.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include colorful fruitbodies, blue staining when injured, brown spore prints, and robust ectomycorrhizal partnerships.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2) confirm **Lanmaoa** as a separate lineage within Boletaceae, distinct from _Boletus_, _Rubroboletus_, and _Butyriboletus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Boletaceae
 ├── Boletus
 ├── Rubroboletus
 ├── Lanmaoa
 ├── Butyriboletus
 └── Others
```
The genus likely evolved in subtropical and temperate forests of East Asia, diversifying along with broadleaf trees.

Important species include:

- _Lanmaoa asiatica_ (type species)
- _Lanmaoa pseudosensibilis_
- _Lanmaoa carminipes_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Broadleaf forests, oak woods, and mixed forests.
- **Substrates:** Soil near tree roots, forming mycorrhizae with hardwoods.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, essential for tree nutrient exchange.

- **Geographic range:** Mainly East and Southeast Asia (China, Japan, Thailand); some species described from North America.

Species fruit in summer to autumn, favoring warm, humid climates.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lanmaoa** fungi are significant ecologically and increasingly recognized:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Lanmaoa carminipes_) are considered edible, but caution is advised due to potential confusion with toxic blue-staining boletes.
  - Proper identification is critical because of their close resemblance to toxic species.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important partners for forest trees, aiding in drought tolerance and nutrient uptake.
  - Help sustain forest biodiversity and health.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for understanding the biogeography and evolution of colorful boletes, especially in Asia.

Their vivid beauty, complex evolutionary relationships, and forest roles make _Lanmaoa_ a fascinating and rapidly developing genus for mycological research.
