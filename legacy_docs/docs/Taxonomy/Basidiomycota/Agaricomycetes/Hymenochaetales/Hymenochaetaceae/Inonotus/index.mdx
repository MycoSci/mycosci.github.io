# Inonotus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Hymenochaetales › **Family:** Hymenochaetaceae › **Genus:** Inonotus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Inonotus hispidus_  
* **Authority & year:** P. Karst., 1879  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Woody bracket fungi, brown to dark brown fruitbodies, pore surfaces, parasitic or saprotrophic, white rot  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Inonotus** was established by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1879. The name comes from Greek _inóne_ ("fibrous tissue") and _otos_ ("ear"), reflecting the fibrous, woody texture of the fruitbodies, which often resemble shelves or ear-like outgrowths on trees.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Inonotus** fungi are classic wood rotters with durable structures:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are perennial or annual, bracket-like or crust-like, tough to woody.
  - Caps are often velvety or hairy (especially when young), colored brown, orange-brown, or dark brown.
  - Pore surfaces are yellowish, brownish, or cinnamon, bruising darker with age or handling.
  - Context tissue (internal flesh) is brown and fibrous to corky.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, pale brown, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include tough fibrous fruitbodies, brownish pores, white rot decay, and lack of clamp connections.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Inonotus** within Hymenochaetaceae, closely related to _Hymenochaete_ and _Phellinus_ but distinguishable by morphology and ecology.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Hymenochaetaceae
 ├── Hymenochaete
 ├── Phellinus
 └── Inonotus
```
The genus likely evolved to specialize in parasitizing and decaying hardwood and conifer trees in both temperate and tropical regions.

Important species include:

- _Inonotus hispidus_ (shaggy bracket)
- _Inonotus obliquus_ (chaga mushroom)
- _Inonotus dryadeus_ (weeping conk)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Living hardwoods and conifers; standing dead trees and fallen logs.
- **Substrates:** Living or dead wood, especially oak, beech, alder, and birch.
- **Trophic modes:** Parasitic (causing white rot in living trees) or saprotrophic (decomposing dead wood).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in temperate forests worldwide.

Species can fruit year-round depending on environmental conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Inonotus** fungi are important in forestry, medicine, and ecology:

- **Edibility:**
  - Most _Inonotus_ species are not edible due to their tough texture.
  - However, _Inonotus obliquus_ ("chaga") is highly valued medicinally (used as a tea or extract for its antioxidant and purported anticancer properties).

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key agents of wood decay, particularly white rot, which recycles lignified material in forests.
  - Some species (_e.g., I. dryadeus_) are significant tree pathogens causing heart rot and weakening large trees.

- **Scientific and medicinal relevance:**
  - _Inonotus obliquus_ is studied for its bioactive compounds, particularly polysaccharides and melanin-rich structures.
  - Important for understanding fungal decay mechanisms and forest pathology.

Their rough beauty, medicinal fame, and critical ecological roles make _Inonotus_ one of the most fascinating genera among wood-inhabiting fungi.
