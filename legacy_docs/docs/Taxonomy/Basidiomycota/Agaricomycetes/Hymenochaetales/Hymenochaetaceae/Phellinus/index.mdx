## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Phellinus igniarius_  
* **Authority & year:** Quél., 1886  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Large, woody shelf fungi, tough perennial fruitbodies, brownish to black pore surfaces, parasitic or saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Phellinus** was described by **Lucien Quélet** in 1886. The name is derived from Greek _phellos_ ("cork") and _-inus_ ("belonging to"), referencing the hard, corky texture of the fruitbodies typical of the group.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Phellinus** fungi are among the most durable and persistent wood rotters:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are perennial, woody, bracket-like (shelf fungi), or crust-like.
  - Surfaces are often cracked, rough, or zoned with darker age rings.
  - Pore surfaces are brown to dark brown, with small, rounded pores.
  - Internal flesh is fibrous, woody, and brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, thick-walled, pale brown in mass, broadly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are typically absent.
  - Many species contain setae — thick-walled, bristle-like sterile cells.

**Synapomorphies** include woody perennial fruitbodies, small brown pores, and tough fibrous structures.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Phellinus** within Hymenochaetaceae, but modern revisions have shown the genus is polyphyletic (containing multiple evolutionary lineages). Ongoing work continues to divide _Phellinus_ into more narrowly defined genera.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Hymenochaetaceae
 ├── Hymenochaete
 ├── Inonotus
 └── Phellinus (complex)
```
The genus likely diversified with the rise of hardwood and coniferous forests, specializing in parasitizing living trees and decomposing deadwood.

Important species include:

- _Phellinus igniarius_ (willow bracket)
- _Phellinus tremulae_ (aspen heart rot)
- _Phellinus robustus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests and woodlands; live trees, standing deadwood, stumps, and logs.
- **Substrates:** Wood of hardwoods (e.g., willow, oak, aspen) and sometimes softwoods.
- **Trophic modes:** Parasitic (causing heart rot in live trees) or saprotrophic (decaying dead wood).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found throughout temperate, boreal, and some tropical regions.

Species can persist for many years, growing new layers annually and continuing to produce spores over decades.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Phellinus** fungi are highly significant in forestry and forest health:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are extremely tough and woody.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Critical decomposers of woody biomass.
  - Some species cause serious economic losses through tree weakening, heart rot, and structural failures.

- **Scientific and medicinal relevance:**
  - Some _Phellinus_ species (e.g., _P. linteus_) are studied for medicinal properties (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory compounds) and used traditionally in East Asian medicine.
  - Important models for white rot enzymology, particularly for lignin degradation.

Their monumental fruitbodies, long lifespan, and critical ecological and medicinal roles make _Phellinus_ one of the most prominent genera of the Hymenochaetales.
