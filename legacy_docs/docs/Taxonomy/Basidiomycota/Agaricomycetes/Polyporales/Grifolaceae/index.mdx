# Grifolaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Grifolaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Grifola frondosa_ (for the type genus _Grifola_)  
* **Authority & year:** Jülich, 1982  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Clustered polypores, rosette- or fan-shaped fruitbodies, white rot, saprotrophic or parasitic on hardwoods  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Grifolaceae** was proposed by **Walter Jülich** in 1982 to accommodate certain fleshy polypores with clustered, often rosette-like growth forms distinct from traditional bracket fungi. It is named after the type genus _Grifola_, originally meaning "curly" or "fringed" in reference to the frondose structure.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Grifolaceae** fungi are highly recognizable among polypores:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are large, fleshy, and made of many fan-shaped or spoon-shaped caps clustered together.
  - Surfaces are dry to slightly velvety; colors vary from whitish to gray, brown, or tan.
  - Undersurfaces have small, round to irregular pores.
  - Texture is firm but not as woody as traditional shelf fungi.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include clustered or fronded fruitbodies, white rot decay, and soft to firm textures (rather than woody).

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb1, rpb2) place **Grifolaceae** firmly within Polyporales but distinguish them from harder, perennial brown rot fungi (like _Fomitopsidaceae_).

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporales
 ├── Polyporaceae
 ├── Fomitopsidaceae
 └── Grifolaceae
```
The family likely evolved adaptations for rapid colonization and nutrient recycling on living and recently dead hardwood trees.

Major genera:

- _Grifola_ (hen of the woods genus)
- _Meripilus_ (black-staining polypore)
- _Polyporellus_ (sometimes included)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Base of hardwood trees (especially oak), stumps, buried roots; forest floors and urban parks.
- **Substrates:** Living or dead hardwoods.
- **Trophic modes:** Primarily saprotrophic, occasionally weakly parasitic (causing butt rot).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; particularly common in temperate zones across Europe, North America, and Asia.

Species often fruit in large spectacular masses during late summer and autumn.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Grifolaceae** fungi are ecologically essential and culturally beloved:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Grifola frondosa_ (maitake or hen of the woods) is a **choice edible mushroom**, highly valued for its rich flavor and medicinal properties.
  - _Meripilus giganteus_ is edible when young but toughens quickly with age.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important decomposers, accelerating nutrient turnover in forest ecosystems.
  - Their parasitic species influence forest structure and dynamics by weakening older trees.

- **Scientific and medicinal relevance:**
  - _Grifola frondosa_ is researched extensively for bioactive compounds with potential anticancer, immunomodulating, and antioxidant effects.
  - Studied for white rot enzymatic systems targeting lignin breakdown.

Their enormous fruitbodies, rich flavors, and roles in both ecosystem health and human culture make _Grifolaceae_ one of the most celebrated fungal families.
