## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Irpex lacteus_  
* **Authority & year:** Fr., 1828  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Thin, soft to leathery crust fungi, poroid to toothed hymenophore, white rot, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Irpex** was described by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1828. The name comes from Latin _irpex_ ("harrow" or "rake"), referencing the comb- or tooth-like appearance of the spore-bearing surface in many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Irpex** fungi are adaptable and easily recognized by their changing hymenophore:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are resupinate (crust-like) to reflexed (edges turning outward slightly).
  - Upper surfaces are often white, cream, grayish, or tan, smooth to cracked.
  - Hymenophores start poroid when young and often become irregular, torn, or tooth-like (hydnoid) as they mature.
  - Fruitbodies are thin and soft when young, becoming tougher with age.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are usually present.

**Synapomorphies** include the transformation of pores into tooth-like structures with age and soft to leathery crust-like growth forms.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Irpex** as a core genus within Irpicaceae, closely related to genera like _Trametopsis_ and _Gelatoporia_.

The genus shows adaptations for rapid colonization and efficient decomposition of deadwood.

Important species include:

- _Irpex lacteus_ (milk-white toothed polypore)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead hardwood and conifer logs, fallen branches, stumps.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot by degrading lignin and cellulose.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in temperate, boreal, and subtropical forests worldwide.

Species fruit abundantly after wet conditions, persisting through drying and cold seasons.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Irpex** fungi are crucial forest decomposers but have little direct human use:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are thin, tough, and serve no culinary value.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major contributors to deadwood decay and nutrient cycling.
  - Help facilitate the breakdown of coarse woody debris, creating habitats for insects and other decomposers.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important for studying fungal community succession on deadwood.
  - Model organisms for examining the transition between poroid and hydnoid hymenophore structures.

Their adaptability, subtle beauty, and key roles in forest decomposition cycles make _Irpex_ a vital genus among white rot fungi.
