# Lenzites <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Polyporales › **Family:** Polyporaceae › **Genus:** Lenzites

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lenzites betulina_  
* **Authority & year:** Fr., 1835  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Bracket fungi with true gills (not pores), leathery to tough texture, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Lenzites** was established by **Elias Magnus Fries** in 1835. It is named in honor of German botanist **Harald Othmar Lenz**, with the suffix _-ites_ indicating connection or belonging, reflecting the distinctive gilled nature of these polypore relatives.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lenzites** species resemble mushrooms more than typical polypores due to their gills:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are bracket-shaped (shelf-like), thin to moderately thick.
  - Upper surfaces are zoned, rough, or hairy, often brownish, gray, or buff.
  - Hymenophores bear well-developed, true gills rather than pores—an unusual feature among polypores.
  - Flesh is firm to tough, often fibrous.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are often present.

**Synapomorphies** include bracket forms, true gills on the undersurface, white rot wood decay, and tough textures.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Lenzites** within the Polyporaceae family, though its gilled morphology highlights an evolutionary transition between gilled mushrooms and polypores.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporaceae
 ├── Polyporus
 ├── Trametes
 └── Lenzites
```
The genus likely represents an evolutionary relic maintaining gilled structures in an otherwise pore-dominated lineage.

Important species include:

- _Lenzites betulina_ (gilled polypore)
- _Lenzites warnieri_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Deadwood in forests, fallen logs, stumps, and standing dead trees.
- **Substrates:** Primarily hardwoods, occasionally conifers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot decomposition.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in temperate and tropical forests worldwide.

Species fruit throughout much of the year and can persist into colder months.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lenzites** fungi are important in forest ecosystems and fungal evolution:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not edible — fruitbodies are tough and woody.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key decomposers of coarse woody debris, crucial for nutrient recycling and forest floor dynamics.
  - Play a role in creating habitats for wood-dependent insects and small mammals.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their evolutionary position between gilled mushrooms and polypores.
  - Serve as models for understanding the transition in hymenophore morphology.

Their gilled undersides, tough bracket forms, and ecological resilience make _Lenzites_ a fascinating genus bridging two major fungal growth forms.
