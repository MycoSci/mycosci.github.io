## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Polyporus squamosus_  
* **Authority & year:** P. Micheli ex Adans., 1763  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Centrally-stalked bracket fungi, poroid undersurfaces, white to cream pores, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Polyporus** was established by **Pier Antonio Micheli** and formalized by **Michel Adanson** in 1763. The name comes from Greek _poly-_ ("many") and _poros_ ("pores"), a direct reference to the spore-discharging structures under the cap.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Polyporus** fungi are some of the classic shelf fungi of forest ecosystems:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are centrally or laterally stalked, round to fan-shaped, flexible to leathery when young, becoming tough with age.
  - Cap surfaces are dry, smooth to scaly, often brown, gray, or buff.
  - Hymenophores are poroid, with small, round pores on the undersurface.
  - Stipes are tough, fibrous, usually black or dark brown at maturity.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are often present.

**Synapomorphies** include centrally-stalked fruitbodies, round pores, tough textures, and white rot decomposition.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Polyporus** within Polyporaceae, though some historical members have been reassigned to new genera based on DNA evidence (_e.g.,_ _Cerioporus_, _Neofavolus_).

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Polyporaceae
 ├── Polyporus
 ├── Trametes
 ├── Lenzites
 └── Neofavolus
```
The genus represents an ancient lineage specializing in white rot and efficient colonization of woody debris.

Important species include:

- _Polyporus squamosus_ (dryad’s saddle)
- _Polyporus varius_
- _Polyporus brumalis_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Hardwood forests, dead or decaying logs, fallen branches, stumps, and sometimes living trees.
- **Substrates:** Hardwood and sometimes conifer wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic; occasionally weakly parasitic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found throughout temperate and tropical forests worldwide.

Species fruit prolifically during spring to autumn, especially after rainfall.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Polyporus** fungi are important for forests and have limited human use:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some young specimens (_e.g., Polyporus squamosus_) are edible when tender but toughen quickly and become inedible.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Efficient decomposers of lignin-rich material, crucial for nutrient cycling and soil formation.
  - Their wood decay creates habitats for insects and other organisms.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - _Polyporus_ species are models for understanding the evolution of polypores, spore dispersal mechanisms, and fungal wood decay strategies.

Their elegant shelf forms, vital roles in decomposition, and place in fungal evolutionary history make _Polyporus_ a cornerstone genus of the Polyporales.
