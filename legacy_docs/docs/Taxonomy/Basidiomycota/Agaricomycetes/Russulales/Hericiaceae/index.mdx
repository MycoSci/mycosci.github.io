## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hericium erinaceus_ (for the type genus _Hericium_)  
* **Authority & year:** Donk, 1961  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Toothed fungi, soft fleshy fruitbodies, cascading spines, white rot decomposers, edible and medicinal species  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Hericiaceae** was established by **Marinus Anton Donk** in 1961 to recognize the unique group of soft, toothed fungi distinct from both coral fungi and polypores. It is named after the genus _Hericium_, originally from Latin _hericius_ ("hedgehog"), a reference to the spiny surfaces of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hericiaceae** fungi are among the most distinctive forest fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are soft to fleshy, often forming globular, branched, or cascading masses.
  - Surfaces are densely covered with long, hanging spines (teeth) instead of gills or pores.
  - Coloration is typically white when fresh, becoming yellowish with age.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, subglobose to broadly ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include soft, spiny fruitbody structures, white rot enzymatic capabilities, and lack of clamp connections.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Hericiaceae** within Russulales, distinct from typical coral fungi (_e.g.,_ _Artomyces_) and polypores, showing a unique evolutionary pathway toward soft, spiny fruitbodies.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Russulales
 ├── Russulaceae
 ├── Albatrellaceae
 └── Hericiaceae
```
The family likely evolved to maximize spore dispersal efficiency by increasing the surface area through hanging spines.

Primary genera:

- _Hericium_ (the main and most widely known genus)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Dead hardwood and sometimes conifer wood; trunks, large branches, and stumps.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead or dying wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic and occasionally weakly parasitic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in temperate and boreal forests worldwide.

Species fruit in late summer and autumn, especially after rainy periods.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hericiaceae** fungi are both ecologically vital and culturally celebrated:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Hericium erinaceus_ (lion’s mane) and related species (_H. coralloides_, _H. americanum_) are **choice edibles**, prized for their mild flavor and seafood-like texture.

- **Medicinal significance:**
  - _Hericium_ species are intensely studied for bioactive compounds promoting nerve regeneration, memory enhancement, and anti-inflammatory properties.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important agents of wood decay, facilitating forest nutrient cycling and habitat creation for small organisms.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Model systems for studying fungal spore dispersal strategies and fungal secondary metabolites.

Their cascading beauty, culinary and medicinal fame, and key ecological functions make _Hericiaceae_ one of the most remarkable fungal families within Russulales.
