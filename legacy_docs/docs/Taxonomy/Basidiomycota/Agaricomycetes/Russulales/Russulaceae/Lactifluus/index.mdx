# Lactifluus <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Russulales › **Family:** Russulaceae › **Genus:** Lactifluus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lactifluus piperatus_  
* **Authority & year:** (Pers.) Roussel, 1806 (raised to genus status by Kuntze, 1891, and modern phylogenetics)  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Brittle-fleshed mushrooms, latex-exuding gills, robust fruitbodies, mostly tropical and subtropical ectomycorrhizal fungi  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Lactifluus** was originally described by **Henri François Anne de Roussel** in 1806 under _Agaricus_, but formally differentiated as a genus by **Otto Kuntze** in 1891. It was traditionally grouped within _Lactarius_ until molecular phylogenetic studies confirmed _Lactifluus_ as a separate lineage. The name means "milk-flowing," referencing the latex exuded from the gills.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lactifluus** species are robust, often tropical mushrooms with distinctive features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are mushroom-shaped, with convex to funnel-shaped caps.
  - Cap surfaces are dry to sticky, often brightly colored—white, orange, brown, yellow.
  - Gills are attached to decurrent, and exude latex ("milk") when cut or damaged.
  - Flesh is brittle due to the presence of sphaerocysts.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are ornamented and strongly amyloid, usually more coarsely reticulate than _Lactarius_.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include latex production, coarse amyloid spore ornamentation, and robust, brittle fruitbodies.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, rpb2) strongly separate **Lactifluus** from _Lactarius_, despite morphological similarities. _Lactifluus_ is now treated as a distinct evolutionary genus within Russulaceae.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Russulaceae
 ├── Russula
 ├── Lactarius
 └── Lactifluus
```
_Lactifluus_ primarily diversified in tropical and subtropical forests, in close association with a wide variety of ectomycorrhizal partners.

Important species include:

- _Lactifluus piperatus_ (peppery milk cap)
- _Lactifluus volemus_ (weeping milk cap)
- _Lactifluus vellereus_ (fleecy milk cap)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Primarily tropical and subtropical forests; some temperate representatives.
- **Substrates:** Soil, associating closely with tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic partnerships with hardwoods and conifers.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread but especially diverse in Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas.

Species fruit mainly during rainy seasons and are common in forest litter layers.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lactifluus** fungi are ecologically crucial and culturally appreciated:

- **Edibility:**
  - Several species (_e.g., Lactifluus volemus_) are edible and appreciated for their mild, nutty flavor.
  - Others (e.g., _L. piperatus_) are acrid and require careful preparation.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major ectomycorrhizal partners supporting tree health, forest resilience, and nutrient cycling.
  - Essential in tropical forest ecosystems where fungal-plant partnerships dominate.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their taxonomy, latex chemistry, and symbiotic evolution with plants.

Their robust fruitbodies, tropical dominance, and critical role in forest ecology make _Lactifluus_ one of the most exciting and important genera within Russulales.
