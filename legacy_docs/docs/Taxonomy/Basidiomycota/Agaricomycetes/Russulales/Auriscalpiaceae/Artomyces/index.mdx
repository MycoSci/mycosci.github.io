# Artomyces <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Russulales › **Family:** Auriscalpiaceae › **Genus:** Artomyces

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Artomyces pyxidatus_  
* **Authority & year:** Jülich, 1982  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Coral-like fungi, regularly branched, flattened or crowned tips, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Artomyces** was established by **Walter Jülich** in 1982 to separate certain coral-like fungi formerly placed in _Clavaria_ or _Ramaria_. The name derives from Greek _artos_ ("joint") and _myces_ ("fungus"), referencing the distinctive branching patterns of the fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Artomyces** species are elegant coral-like fungi with unique branching features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are upright, highly branched, and coral-like, typically small to medium in size.
  - Branch tips are often flattened or crown-like (pyxidate).
  - Coloration ranges from white, cream, to pale tan or slightly pinkish.
  - Flesh is brittle and fragile.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are usually absent.

**Synapomorphies** include coral-like branching forms, distinctive crowned or flattened branch tips, and white rot enzymatic decomposition.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Artomyces** securely within Auriscalpiaceae, closely related to _Auriscalpium_ but morphologically differentiated by its coral structure.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Auriscalpiaceae
 ├── Auriscalpium
 └── Artomyces
```
The genus likely evolved to maximize spore dispersal through branched, three-dimensional fruiting structures in forest litter layers.

Important species include:

- _Artomyces pyxidatus_ (crown-tipped coral)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Fallen logs, stumps, and rich leaf litter in coniferous and mixed forests.
- **Substrates:** Dead or decaying hardwood and conifer wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, causing white rot.

- **Geographic range:** Temperate forests across North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species fruit in summer through autumn, often after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Artomyces** fungi are appreciated for their delicate structures and ecological significance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Artomyces pyxidatus_) are considered edible when young and tender, though not widely collected due to their small size and fragility.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Contribute to decomposition of forest debris, recycling nutrients back into ecosystems.
  - Support biodiversity by creating microhabitats in rotting wood.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for insights into coral-fungus morphology evolution and forest floor fungal diversity.

Their coral-like forms, role in nutrient cycling, and delicate forest beauty make _Artomyces_ an important and often admired genus in fungal ecology.
