## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Albatrellus ovinus_  
* **Authority & year:** Gray, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Soft, fleshy polypores, centrally stalked or sessile, white to colorful caps, small round pores, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Albatrellus** was described by **Samuel Frederick Gray** in 1821. The name likely derives from Latin _albus_ ("white") and _trellus_ (a diminutive suffix), referencing the typically pale coloration of many species.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Albatrellus** species are recognizable by their soft textures and forest floor habitats:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are centrally stalked or sessile, cap-like or rosette-formed.
  - Caps are dry, smooth, or slightly scaly; colors range from white, cream, pinkish, yellow, to bright blue (_A. flettii_).
  - Pore surfaces are white, cream, or slightly colored, with small, round pores.
  - Flesh is thick, soft when young, firming with age.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, broadly ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are present.

**Synapomorphies** include fleshy texture, centrally-stalked forms, and white rot decomposition.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Albatrellus** firmly within Albatrellaceae (Russulales), closely allied to polypore-like fungi despite producing more agaric-like, fleshy fruitbodies.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Russulales
 ├── Russulaceae
 └── Albatrellaceae
      └── Albatrellus
```
The genus evolved strategies to fruit abundantly on forest floors where quick decay and dispersal are advantageous.

Important species include:

- _Albatrellus ovinus_ (sheep polypore)
- _Albatrellus confluens_
- _Albatrellus flettii_ (blue-staining polypore)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous and mixed forests, often on the ground near tree roots or buried wood.
- **Substrates:** Soil, occasionally decayed wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic and sometimes weakly ectomycorrhizal.

- **Geographic range:** Widespread across North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.

Species typically fruit from late summer through autumn.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Albatrellus** fungi are ecologically important and occasionally edible:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Albatrellus ovinus_) are edible and considered good when young.
  - Others may be bitter or tough with age.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key contributors to white rot decomposition and soil formation.
  - Play a supporting role in forest ecosystem health by recycling organic material.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - _Albatrellus flettii_ is notable for its unusual blue pigments and is studied for fungal biochemistry and taxonomy.

Their humble beauty, important forest roles, and sometimes surprising colors make _Albatrellus_ a notable genus among soft polypores.
