## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Bondarzewia montana_  
* **Authority & year:** Singer, 1940  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Large rosette-like fungi, soft to tough flesh, gills or gill-like structures, ornamented amyloid spores, white rot decomposers  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Bondarzewia** was described by **Rolf Singer** in 1940. It honors **Apollinarii Semenovich Bondarzew**, a pioneering Russian mycologist known for his important contributions to forest mycology.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Bondarzewia** species are impressive and visually striking fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are large, forming rosette-like clusters at the base of trees or stumps.
  - Caps are thick, fan- or spoon-shaped, often brownish, yellowish, or tan with concentric zoning.
  - Hymenophores are either gilled or gill-like (a rare trait among typical polypores).
  - Flesh is firm, white, and fibrous.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are ornamented and amyloid (staining blue-black in Melzer’s reagent), similar to _Russula_ and _Lactarius_.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include large, fleshy growth forms, amyloid ornamented spores, and white rot wood decay.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Bondarzewia** firmly within the Bondarzewiaceae family of Russulales, highlighting its ancient connections to gilled mushrooms rather than classic polypores.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Russulales
 ├── Russulaceae
 ├── Albatrellaceae
 └── Bondarzewiaceae
      └── Bondarzewia
```
The genus likely evolved by combining features of gilled fungi (like Russulaceae) with robust wood-decomposing forms.

Important species include:

- _Bondarzewia montana_ (the type species)
- _Bondarzewia berkeleyi_ (berkeley's polypore)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** At the base of living or dead coniferous and hardwood trees; often associated with root systems.
- **Substrates:** Roots, stumps, soil enriched with buried wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Weakly parasitic to saprotrophic; causes butt and root rot.

- **Geographic range:** Found in temperate forests across North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species typically fruit in summer and autumn, producing enormous fruitbodies that can persist for weeks.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Bondarzewia** fungi are ecologically and culturally significant:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (_e.g., Bondarzewia berkeleyi_) are edible when young and tender, though not highly sought after compared to other wild mushrooms.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major decomposers of woody substrates, accelerating nutrient recycling.
  - Their parasitic activity can weaken trees, opening canopy gaps and fostering biodiversity.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their amyloid spores linking them to other Russulales members.
  - Important for understanding transitions between gilled mushrooms and large polypore-like forms.

Their giant, rosette-forming structures, unique evolutionary position, and ecological importance make _Bondarzewia_ a key genus among the forest fungi.
