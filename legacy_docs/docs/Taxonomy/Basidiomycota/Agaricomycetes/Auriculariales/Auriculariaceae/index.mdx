# Auriculariaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Auriculariales › **Family:** Auriculariaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Auricularia auricula-judae_ (for the type genus _Auricularia_)  
* **Authority & year:** Rea, 1922  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gelatinous to leathery fruitbodies, ear- or brain-shaped, septate basidia, white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Auriculariaceae** was formally established by **Carleton Rea** in 1922 to group fungi with gelatinous basidiocarps and longitudinally septate basidia. It is named after the type genus _Auricularia_, meaning "little ear," in reference to the typical shape of its fruiting bodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Auriculariaceae** fungi are diverse in appearance but unified by key microscopic and ecological traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are gelatinous, rubbery, or leathery, often ear-shaped, lobed, or brain-like.
  - Colors range from translucent white to gray, brown, purple, or black.
  - Surfaces can be smooth, veined, or finely hairy depending on the species.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are longitudinally or obliquely septate, unlike typical club-shaped basidia in most agarics.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are present at septa.

**Synapomorphies** include gelatinous textures, septate basidia, and white spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) confirm **Auriculariaceae** as a monophyletic lineage within Auriculariales, distinct from other jelly fungi like _Exidiaceae_.

Major genera include:

- _Auricularia_ (wood ear fungi)
- _Exidia_ (sometimes segregated; many studies place _Exidia_ in Exidiaceae)
- _Aurantiporus_ (if included under broader definitions)

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Auriculariales
 ├── Auriculariaceae
 ├── Exidiaceae
 └── Hyaloriaceae
```
The family likely originated early in the evolutionary history of Basidiomycetes, adapting to humid, wood-rich environments.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests (temperate and tropical), deadwood, stumps, fallen branches, occasionally living trees.
- **Substrates:** Dead hardwoods and sometimes conifers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic; occasionally weakly parasitic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found across all continents except Antarctica, thriving in moist environments.

Species typically fruit after rains and in humid conditions, especially in shaded forest settings.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Auriculariaceae** fungi are ecologically vital and culturally important:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Auricularia auricula-judae_ (wood ear, black fungus) and relatives are highly valued edible mushrooms in East Asian cuisines.
  - Cultivated on logs, sawdust, or agricultural waste in China, Japan, Thailand, and beyond.

- **Medicinal significance:**
  - Wood ear mushrooms are traditionally used in Chinese medicine to promote blood circulation, lower cholesterol, and improve immune function.
  - Scientific studies show antioxidant, antitumor, and immunomodulatory effects.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Major decomposers of lignin and cellulose in deadwood, recycling nutrients into forest ecosystems.

Their culinary value, medicinal promise, and ecological contributions make Auriculariaceae one of the most remarkable families of fungi globally.
