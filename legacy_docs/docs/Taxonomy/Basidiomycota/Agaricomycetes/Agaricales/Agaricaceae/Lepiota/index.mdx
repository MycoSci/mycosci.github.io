## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Lepiota cristata_  
* **Authority & year:** (Persoon) Gray, 1821  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium mushrooms, free gills, brown spore prints, scaly caps, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Lepiota** was established by **Samuel Frederick Gray** in 1821, based on earlier work by **Christiaan Hendrik Persoon**. The name is derived from Greek _lepís_ (λεπίς), meaning "scale," a reference to the scaly appearance of many species' caps. Historically, _Lepiota_ served as a large catch-all for white-spored mushrooms with free gills, but molecular phylogenetics has significantly narrowed and clarified its boundaries.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Lepiota** species share a set of distinct traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Small to medium-sized mushrooms with thin, brittle flesh.
  - Caps (pilei) typically scaly or squamulose, often whitish, brownish, or yellowish.
  - Gills are free from the stipe and often crowded.
  - Spore print is usually white, cream, or pale brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, bearing four basidiospores.
  - Spores are smooth, often ellipsoid, sometimes dextrinoid (staining reddish-brown in Melzer’s reagent).
  - Cheilocystidia and pileocystidia are usually abundant and important for species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include free gills, scaly caps, and small to medium stature with pale spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) indicate that **Lepiota** is monophyletic when narrowly defined, distinct from closely related genera such as _Macrolepiota_, _Leucoagaricus_, and _Chlorophyllum_.

_Lepiota_ likely diversified relatively recently, adapting to grasslands, forest floors, and disturbed habitats.

Recognized important species include:

- _Lepiota cristata_ (stinking dapperling)
- _Lepiota brunneoincarnata_ (a deadly species)
- _Lepiota clypeolaria_ (shield dapperling)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, woodlands, gardens, forest edges, and compost heaps.
- **Substrates:** Soil, leaf litter, organic-rich environments.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic matter.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; species occur worldwide, particularly in temperate and subtropical zones.

Some species fruit solitarily while others may appear in small troops or scattered groups.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Lepiota** fungi are important ecologically but must be treated with caution:

- **Toxicity:**
  - Several _Lepiota_ species (e.g., _L. brunneoincarnata_, _L. helveola_) are deadly poisonous due to the presence of amatoxins, the same lethal compounds found in _Amanita_ species.
  - Misidentification has led to fatal mushroom poisoning incidents.

- **Edibility:**
  - Few _Lepiota_ species are regarded as edible, and most are avoided due to potential confusion with toxic relatives.

- **Ecological role:**
  - Important decomposers in soil ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Some species, like _Lepiota cristata_, are familiar to foragers and mushroom enthusiasts but are considered inedible due to their unpleasant odor or potential toxicity.

Identification to species level within _Lepiota_ requires great care, and general avoidance for consumption is recommended.
