## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Coprinus comatus_  
* **Authority & year:** Persoon, 1797  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Inky caps, deliquescent gills, rapid autolysis, shaggy or smooth caps, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Coprinus** was described by **Christiaan Hendrik Persoon** in 1797. The name derives from the Greek _koprinos_ (κοπρινός), meaning "living on dung," referencing the dung-loving habitat of many species. Historically, _Coprinus_ included a broad array of "inky cap" mushrooms, but molecular studies have greatly restricted the genus, leaving only a few species like _Coprinus comatus_ in the true _Coprinus_ sensu stricto, while others were moved to genera like _Coprinellus_, _Coprinopsis_, and _Parasola_.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Coprinus** species, particularly the iconic _Coprinus comatus_, have highly recognizable features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are initially cylindrical and covered with shaggy scales (especially in _C. comatus_).
  - Gills are free from the stipe and turn black, liquefying (deliquescing) as the mushroom matures to aid spore dispersal.
  - Spore print is black.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typical club-shaped structures producing four spores externally.
  - Spores are smooth, blackish, and ellipsoid to almond-shaped, often with a germ pore.
  - Cap cells often collapse and liquefy during maturation, contributing to deliquescence.

**Synapomorphies** include deliquescent gills and rapid cap collapse with age.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB2) demonstrated that the traditional large genus **Coprinus** was polyphyletic. As a result:

- _Coprinus_ sensu stricto now contains only a few species, mainly _C. comatus_ and close relatives.
- Other former "inky caps" were moved to _Coprinellus_, _Coprinopsis_, and _Parasola_ in the family Psathyrellaceae.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Agaricaceae
 └── Coprinus
Psathyrellaceae
 ├── Coprinopsis
 ├── Coprinellus
 └── Parasola
```
True _Coprinus_ species are more closely related to _Agaricus_ and other Agaricaceae members than to Psathyrellaceae inky caps.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, lawns, roadsides, compost heaps, and dung-enriched soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in organic material, dung, wood chips.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic matter.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found worldwide in temperate and subtropical regions.

_Coprinus_ species often fruit prolifically after rain and are well-adapted to disturbed, nutrient-rich habitats.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Coprinus**, especially _Coprinus comatus_, has culinary, ecological, and cultural relevance:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Coprinus comatus_ ("shaggy mane") is edible and highly regarded when young, before gills begin to liquefy.
  - Should be cooked soon after harvesting to prevent rapid spoilage.

- **Medicinal research:**
  - Extracts from _C. comatus_ are studied for possible antidiabetic and antioxidant properties.

- **Ecological role:**
  - Important decomposers, helping to recycle nutrients in disturbed soils and urban environments.

- **Cultural significance:**
  - "Shaggy manes" are familiar sights in parks and fields and are featured in mushroom identification guides and foraging communities.

Their striking transformation from upright white cylinders to dripping black "ink" makes _Coprinus_ species some of the most memorable fungi in nature.
