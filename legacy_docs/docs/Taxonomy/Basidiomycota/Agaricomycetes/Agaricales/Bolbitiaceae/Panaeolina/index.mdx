## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Panaeolina foenisecii_  
* **Authority & year:** Maire, 1933  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small brown mushrooms, mottled dark gills, ornamented spores, saprotrophic, grassland habitats  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Panaeolina** was established by **René Charles Joseph Ernest Maire** in 1933 to separate certain dark-spored, small brown mushrooms from _Panaeolus_. The name _Panaeolina_ reflects its close morphological resemblance to _Panaeolus_ (the "mottlegills") while highlighting subtle differences, especially in spore structure and pigmentation.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Panaeolina** species are subtle but distinctive in careful examination:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Small, thin-fleshed mushrooms with brownish to grayish-brown caps.
  - Gills are attached to free, mottled with uneven patches of dark and lighter colors.
  - Spore print is dark brown to purplish-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped and produce four spores externally.
  - Spores are ornamented (warted or roughened), brown, and ellipsoid.
  - Cystidia (specialized sterile cells) are common and useful for species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include ornamented spores and mottled gill patterns distinct from _Panaeolus_ (which has smooth spores).

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Panaeolina** securely within Bolbitiaceae, although some earlier systems grouped it within _Panaeolus_ or related genera.

_Panaeolina_ evolved alongside grassland and meadow ecosystems, favoring organic-rich soils and disturbed habitats.

Important species include:

- _Panaeolina foenisecii_ (lawn mower’s mushroom)
- _Panaeolina sagarae_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Lawns, pastures, grassy fields, and occasionally on moss or organic debris.
- **Substrates:** Soil rich in decomposing plant material, occasionally dung-enriched soils.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing grass clippings, dead moss, and leaf litter.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across temperate and subtropical regions, common in urban and suburban lawns.

_Panaeolina_ species fruit prolifically after rain, often appearing in massive numbers.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Panaeolina** fungi are often overlooked but important ecologically:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Panaeolina foenisecii_ is considered non-toxic but of little culinary value.
  - Some reports suggest minor psychoactive effects, but chemical analyses generally show minimal or no psilocybin presence, unlike true _Panaeolus_ species.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Rapid decomposers, recycling organic matter in grassland and disturbed ecosystems.
  - Important for maintaining healthy lawn and pasture soils.

- **Cautionary notes:**
  - Misidentification risks exist: similar-looking species in _Panaeolus_ may be psychoactive.
  - Field guides often warn that brown lawn mushrooms should be treated with caution.

Their small size and ubiquity in lawns make _Panaeolina_ some of the most encountered but least appreciated mushrooms by casual observers.
