# Agaricales <Badge variant="note" text="Order" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Order  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Agaricus campestris_ (for the type genus _Agaricus_)  
* **Authority & year:** Underwood, 1899  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Gilled mushrooms, basidiocarps with lamellae (gills), saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, or parasitic lifestyles  

## Discovery & Naming
The order **Agaricales** was formally described by **Lucien Marcus Underwood** in 1899. The name is derived from the genus _Agaricus_, the classic group of gilled mushrooms that includes the edible button mushroom. Although initially grouped purely by gill morphology, modern molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed Agaricales as a robust, monophyletic lineage within Agaricomycetes.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Agaricales** encompasses a wide range of morphologies but shares core features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) typically have a distinct cap (pileus) and stalk (stipe), with gills (lamellae) on the underside.
  - Color, size, and shape are extremely diverse, from tiny Mycena species to large _Macrolepiota_ and _Amanita_.
  - Some species form non-gilled structures like veined or pore-bearing surfaces (e.g., _Cantharellus_, _Lentinus_).

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped and produce usually four basidiospores externally.
  - Spores can be smooth or ornamented, hyaline or pigmented, and with or without germ pores.

**Synapomorphies** include lamellate hymenophores in most species and the external production of basidiospores on basidia.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2, TEF1) recognize **Agaricales** as a highly diverse and ancient order.

Major families include:

- _Agaricaceae_ (button mushrooms, field mushrooms)
- _Amanitaceae_ (Amanitas)
- _Cortinariaceae_ (webcaps)
- _Marasmiaceae_ (marasmioid fungi)
- _Pluteaceae_ (pluteoid mushrooms)

The Agaricales likely began diversifying during the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous (~150–100 million years ago), coinciding with the rise of angiosperm-dominated forests.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Extremely broad — forests, grasslands, tundras, tropical rainforests, woodlands, deserts.
- **Substrates:** Soil, wood, litter, dung, living plants, moss, other fungi.
- **Trophic modes:**
  - Saprotrophic (litter and wood decomposers).
  - Mycorrhizal (mutualists with tree roots — e.g., _Amanita_, _Russula_).
  - Parasitic (on plants, insects, or other fungi).

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan — from the Arctic tundra to tropical rainforests.

Agaricales includes some of the most ecologically dominant and visible fungi worldwide.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Agaricales** fungi have profound economic, culinary, medical, and cultural significance:

- **Edible species:**
  - _Agaricus bisporus_ (white button mushroom)
  - _Pleurotus ostreatus_ (oyster mushroom)
  - _Lentinula edodes_ (shiitake)

- **Poisonous species:**
  - _Amanita phalloides_ (death cap)
  - _Galerina marginata_ (deadly Galerina)
  - _Cortinarius_ species (containing orellanine toxin)

- **Medicinal fungi:**
  - Several species are explored for antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer properties.

- **Ecological impact:**
  - Mycorrhizal Agaricales form vital nutrient networks in forests.
  - Saprotrophic species recycle carbon and nutrients in ecosystems.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Mushrooms of the Agaricales feature prominently in folklore, religion, art, and modern media, from fairy tales to contemporary literature.

From delicious foods to deadly poisons, the Agaricales represent the most diverse and visible group of mushroom-forming fungi.
