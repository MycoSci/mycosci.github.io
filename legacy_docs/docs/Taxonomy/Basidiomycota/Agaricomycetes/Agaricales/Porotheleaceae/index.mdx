# Porotheleaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Porotheleaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Porotheleum fimbriatum_ (for the type genus _Porotheleum_)  
* **Authority & year:** Jülich, 1981  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized mushrooms, often wood- or litter-inhabiting, white to pale spore prints, smooth spores  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Porotheleaceae** was formally established by **Walter Jülich** in 1981 based on the type genus _Porotheleum_. Its members were once scattered across various families but have since been united by molecular phylogenetic evidence, showing they form a distinct evolutionary lineage within Agaricales.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Porotheleaceae** fungi are modest and often overlooked but share important features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies range from small to medium-sized, with convex to flat caps.
  - Colors vary from white, grayish, brown, to tan; usually dull and earthy tones.
  - Gills are typically attached (adnate to adnexed), often crowded and pale-colored.
  - Stipes are central, slender to moderately stout.
  - Spore prints are white to pale cream.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid to subglobose.
  - Clamp connections are often present.

**Synapomorphies** include pale spore prints, smooth spores, and saprotrophic habits, often on wood or leaf litter.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular studies (ITS, LSU) support **Porotheleaceae** as a coherent family, separate from _Marasmiaceae_ and _Mycenaceae_, although traditionally many species were lumped into those groups based on morphology.

Major genera include:

- _Porotheleum_ (type genus)
- _Megacollybia_ (formerly placed in _Tricholomataceae_)
- _Clitocybula_
- _Trogia_
- _Amparoina_

The family likely diversified during the Cenozoic, filling niches in forest litter, woody debris, and low-nutrient substrates.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, decaying wood, mossy areas, soil, leaf litter, and occasionally herbaceous stems.
- **Substrates:** Decomposing organic matter—especially in damp, shaded environments.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, aiding in the decomposition of lignin, cellulose, and plant debris.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widely distributed across temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions.

Species often fruit in humid, rainy seasons and may persist through cool, wet conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Porotheleaceae** fungi are more ecologically significant than culturally famous:

- **Edibility:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Megacollybia platyphylla_) are edible, although few are widely sought after for food.
  - Most are too small, tough, or inconspicuous to have culinary value.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Vital decomposers of dead wood and litter, enhancing soil health and nutrient cycling.
  - Particularly important in forest ecosystems where they help recycle organic material.

- **Scientific interest:**
  - Studied for insights into saprotrophic fungal diversity and evolutionary relationships within Agaricales.

Their understated appearance hides their crucial role in sustaining healthy forest ecosystems worldwide.
