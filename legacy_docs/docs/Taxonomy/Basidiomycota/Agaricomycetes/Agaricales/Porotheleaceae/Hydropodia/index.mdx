# Hydropodia <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Porotheleaceae › **Genus:** Hydropodia

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hydropodia subalpina_  
* **Authority & year:** Kühner ex Singer, 1962  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small mushrooms, moist habitats, white to pale spore prints, smooth spores, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Hydropodia** was established by **Rolf Singer** in 1962, building on the groundwork laid by **Robert Kühner**. The name _Hydropodia_ combines Greek _hydro-_ ("water") and _podia_ ("foot" or "stalk"), referring to the genus' preference for moist environments and its slender-stalked fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hydropodia** species are modest, moisture-loving mushrooms:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are small, convex to bell-shaped, often moist or slightly sticky.
  - Colors are pale brownish, whitish, or tan.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to slightly decurrent), white to cream-colored.
  - Stipes are slender, smooth, flexible, and relatively long compared to the cap size.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Cheilocystidia are present and important for species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include pale, moist-loving fruitbodies, slender stipes, and white spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Hydropodia** within Porotheleaceae, distinct from closely related genera like _Porotheleum_ and _Megacollybia_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Porotheleaceae
 ├── Porotheleum
 ├── Hydropodia
 ├── Megacollybia
 ├── Trogia
 └── Clitocybula
```
The genus likely evolved alongside moist forest ecosystems, specializing in saprotrophic decomposition in high-humidity environments.

Key species:

- _Hydropodia subalpina_ (the principal species currently recognized)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist forest floors, near streams, in boggy areas, mossy banks, and alpine meadows.
- **Substrates:** Decomposing leaf litter, mosses, wet woody debris.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, aiding decomposition in wet, shaded habitats.

- **Geographic range:** Scattered reports from Europe and temperate Asia; likely underreported elsewhere.

Species fruit during rainy seasons or persistently damp periods, favoring undisturbed microhabitats.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hydropodia** fungi are ecologically important but have minimal direct cultural or economic relevance:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not considered edible due to small size, rarity, and lack of culinary interest.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important contributors to organic matter recycling in moist ecosystems.
  - Help maintain soil moisture balance and support moss-dominated microhabitats.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Of interest to taxonomists studying forest floor fungal biodiversity, especially in wet environments.

Their understated presence belies a significant role in the quiet maintenance of forest soil ecosystems.
