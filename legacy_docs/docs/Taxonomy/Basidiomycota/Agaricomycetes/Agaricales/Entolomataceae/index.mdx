# Entolomataceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Entolomataceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Entoloma sinuatum_ (for the type genus _Entoloma_)  
* **Authority & year:** Kotlaba, 1972  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Pink spore prints, angular (polyhedral) spores, free or attached gills, saprotrophic or mycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Entolomataceae** was established by **František Kotlaba** in 1972 to accommodate fungi characterized by pink spore prints and distinctive angular spores. The name is based on the type genus _Entoloma_, originally described by early mycologists for mushrooms with sinuate gill attachment and unusual spore shapes.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Entolomataceae** fungi display a variety of forms but share key unifying features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Basidiocarps range from small to medium-sized, with caps that may be convex, depressed, or bell-shaped.
  - Gills can be attached (sinuate, adnexed) or free, typically turning pinkish as spores mature.
  - Stipes are usually central and vary from slender to stout.
  - Spore prints are pink to salmon-colored.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, producing four spores externally.
  - Spores are typically angular, polygonal, or polyhedral in shape, a unique hallmark of the family.
  - Spores are smooth to faintly ornamented and pinkish in deposit.

**Synapomorphies** include pink spore prints and distinctly angular or polygonal spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) strongly support **Entolomataceae** as a distinct and monophyletic family within Agaricales.

Major genera within Entolomataceae include:

- _Entoloma_ (largest genus; formerly included _Nolanea_, _Leptonia_, etc.)
- _Clitopilus_
- _Rhodocybe_
- _Richoniella_

      ├── Entoloma
      ├── Clitopilus
      ├── Rhodocybe
      └── Richoniella
```
The diversification of Entolomataceae likely paralleled the rise of angiosperm-dominated ecosystems during the Cretaceous and early Paleogene.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Grasslands, woodlands, heathlands, and forest floors; often in moss, leaf litter, or grassy areas.
- **Substrates:** Soil, dead plant material, moss beds.
- **Trophic modes:**
  - Predominantly saprotrophic, breaking down organic matter.
  - Some species (especially _Entoloma_ and _Clitopilus_) may be weakly mycorrhizal.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widely distributed across tropical, temperate, and boreal ecosystems.

Species are especially diverse in temperate grasslands and ancient forests.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Entolomataceae** fungi have mixed significance for humans:

- **Edibility and toxicity:**
  - Some species (e.g., _Entoloma abortivum_, _Clitopilus prunulus_) are edible and valued by foragers.
  - Many _Entoloma_ species are toxic, causing gastrointestinal upset (_Entoloma sinuatum_ is particularly notorious).

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Key decomposers in grassland and forest ecosystems, contributing to nutrient recycling.
  - Some species act as early colonizers of disturbed soils.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Several _Entoloma_ species are considered indicators of ancient, unimproved grasslands and are targeted in fungal conservation efforts.

Their beauty, spore structure, and ecological roles make _Entolomataceae_ a fascinating and important family within the gilled mushrooms.
