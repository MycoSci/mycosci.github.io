**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Mycenaceae › **Genus:** Xeromphalina

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Xeromphalina campanella_  
* **Authority & year:** Kühner & Maire, 1934  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Tiny mushrooms with tough wiry stems, dry caps, often clustered on wood, white spore prints  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Xeromphalina** was established by **Robert Kühner** and **René Maire** in 1934. The name combines the Greek _xeros_ ("dry") and _omphalos_ ("navel"), referring to the typically dry, centrally depressed ("navel-like") caps of these small wood-inhabiting mushrooms.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Xeromphalina** species are small, resilient mushrooms suited to wood decomposition:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are tiny (usually under 3 cm), dry, convex to umbilicate (navel-shaped).
  - Colors range from yellowish, orange, brownish to ochre.
  - Gills are adnate to decurrent, thin, and often pale.
  - Stipes are wiry, tough, often brownish or reddish toward the base, sometimes with hairs.
  - Fruiting bodies typically grow in tight clusters.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Cheilocystidia are present and helpful for species-level identification.

**Synapomorphies** include dry caps, navel-shaped centers, wiry stems, and clustering habit on wood or litter.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) position **Xeromphalina** within Mycenaceae, allied with _Mycena_, _Panellus_, and _Cruentomycena_.

_Xeromphalina_ likely diversified in moist forest environments during the Cenozoic, exploiting decaying wood substrates.

Important species include:

- _Xeromphalina campanella_ (bell Omphalina)
- _Xeromphalina kauffmanii_
- _Xeromphalina brunneola_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Coniferous and mixed forests, mossy logs, damp woody debris, sometimes leaf litter.
- **Substrates:** Primarily dead wood and woody plant material.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing lignified materials in forest ecosystems.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in temperate and boreal regions, especially across North America, Europe, and Asia.

Species often fruit abundantly in moist, shaded environments after rains.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Xeromphalina** fungi, while small, are ecologically important:

- **Edibility:**
  - Generally considered inedible due to their small size and tough texture.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Major decomposers of dead wood, aiding in nutrient recycling and soil formation.
  - Their presence indicates healthy decomposition processes within forests.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Sometimes admired for their beauty and resilience in mossy, damp environments.
  - Occasionally referenced in mushroom field guides as charming miniature fungi.

Despite their tiny size, _Xeromphalina_ species play a vital role in sustaining forest floor ecosystems.
