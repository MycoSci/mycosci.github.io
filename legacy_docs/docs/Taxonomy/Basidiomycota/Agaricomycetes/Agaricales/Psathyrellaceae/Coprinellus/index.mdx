**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Psathyrellaceae › **Genus:** Coprinellus

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Coprinellus micaceus_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) P. Karsten, 1879  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium inky caps, dark brown spore prints, fragile fruitbodies, often with micaceous (shiny) veil remnants  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Coprinellus** was separated from _Coprinus_ by **Petter Adolf Karsten** in 1879, and modern molecular work (Vilgalys et al., 2001) confirmed it as distinct. The name means "small Coprinus," referring to its smaller size and somewhat reduced tendency to deliquesce (self-digest) compared to true inky caps like _Coprinopsis_.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Coprinellus** species display classic "inky cap" features but are subtly distinctive:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are bell-shaped to campanulate, often splitting radially with age.
  - Surfaces can be smooth or covered in glistening mica-like particles (especially in _C. micaceus_).
  - Gills are crowded, free, and change from pale to dark gray or black as spores mature.
  - Stipes are slender, white, often hollow and fragile.
  - Spore prints are dark brown to blackish.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, dark brown, ellipsoid to ovoid, often with a distinct germ pore.
  - Cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia are abundant and useful for species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include dark spore prints, fragile, radially splitting caps, and reduced or delayed deliquescence.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Coprinellus** firmly within Psathyrellaceae, distinct from _Coprinopsis_ (larger, strongly deliquescent species) and _Parasola_ (non-deliquescent inky caps).

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Psathyrellaceae
 ├── Psathyrella
 ├── Coprinellus
 ├── Coprinopsis
 ├── Parasola
 └── Britzelmayria
```
The genus diversified in open habitats, exploiting dung, wood debris, compost, and nutrient-rich soils.

Key species include:

- _Coprinellus micaceus_ (mica cap)
- _Coprinellus disseminatus_ (fairy inkcap)
- _Coprinellus truncorum_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Lawns, parks, gardens, woodlands, pastures, compost heaps, and decaying logs.
- **Substrates:** Dead wood, dung, rich soil, leaf litter, compost.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing organic matter rapidly.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions.

Species often appear in large troops after rain, sometimes overnight.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Coprinellus** fungi are appreciated ecologically and occasionally culinarily:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Coprinellus micaceus_ is edible when young (before caps darken), though not highly regarded compared to larger edible mushrooms.
  - Consumption is safe without alcohol, unlike some related species (e.g., _Coprinopsis atramentaria_).

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Key decomposers of wood, dung, and organic debris.
  - Important for early-stage recycling of nutrients into soil ecosystems.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Their deliquescent or splitting gills are a fascinating evolutionary adaptation to enhance rapid spore dispersal.

Their ephemeral beauty, important ecological roles, and easy recognition make _Coprinellus_ a standout genus among the delicate dark-spored fungi.
