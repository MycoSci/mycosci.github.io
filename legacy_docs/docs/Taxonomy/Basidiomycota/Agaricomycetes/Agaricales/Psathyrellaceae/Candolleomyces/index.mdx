# Candolleomyces <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Psathyrellaceae › **Genus:** Candolleomyces

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Candolleomyces candolleanus_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fr.) D. Wächter & A. Melzer, 2020  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small to medium-sized fragile mushrooms, white to tan caps, dark brown to black spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Candolleomyces** was established by **Dominik Wächter** and **Andreas Melzer** in 2020 following molecular reclassification of species formerly placed in _Psathyrella_. The name honors **Augustin Pyramus de Candolle**, an early influential Swiss botanist, and reflects the genus' historical roots within classical European taxonomy.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Candolleomyces** species resemble typical small brown mushrooms but have refined distinctions:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are fragile, convex to broadly conical, often cream to tan, sometimes splitting radially with age.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to adnexed), initially pale, darkening to smoky brown as spores mature.
  - Stipes are slender, fragile, often whitish or pale brown.
  - Spore prints are dark brown to blackish.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are four-spored, club-shaped.
  - Spores are smooth, ellipsoid to broadly oval, dark brown in deposit.
  - Cheilocystidia are abundant and morphologically variable.

**Synapomorphies** include fragile basidiocarps, dark spore prints, and saprotrophic habits.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) demonstrate that **Candolleomyces** forms a distinct, monophyletic group within Psathyrellaceae, separated from _Psathyrella_ and _Coprinellus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Psathyrellaceae
 ├── Psathyrella
 ├── Coprinellus
 ├── Coprinopsis
 ├── Candolleomyces
 └── Britzelmayria
```
The genus likely diversified in temperate and subtropical ecosystems, filling niches in leaf litter decomposition and disturbed soils.

Key species:

- _Candolleomyces candolleanus_ (type species)
- _Candolleomyces leucotephrus_
- _Candolleomyces tricolor_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forest floors, gardens, grasslands, parks, and disturbed areas.
- **Substrates:** Leaf litter, wood chips, rich organic soil, decomposing plant debris.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, aiding rapid breakdown of organic matter.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found across Europe, North America, Asia, and other temperate zones.

Species fruit prolifically after rain, especially in humid, nutrient-rich environments.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Candolleomyces** fungi are ecologically important but little used directly by humans:

- **Edibility:**
  - Generally considered inedible due to small size, fragility, and lack of culinary value.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers in forest and urban ecosystems.
  - Contribute significantly to the nutrient cycling of leaf litter and fine woody debris.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Their reclassification highlights the power of molecular phylogenetics to reveal hidden diversity in superficially similar fungi.

Their understated role in organic matter decomposition underscores their ecological importance in maintaining healthy soils.
