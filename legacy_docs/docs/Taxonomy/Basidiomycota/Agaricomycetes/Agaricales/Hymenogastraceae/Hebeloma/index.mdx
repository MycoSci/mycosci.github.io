**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Hymenogastraceae › **Genus:** Hebeloma

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Hebeloma crustuliniforme_  
* **Authority & year:** (Bull.) P. Kummer, 1871  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized brownish mushrooms, farinaceous (mealy) odor, brown spore prints, ectomycorrhizal or saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Hebeloma** was established by **Paul Kummer** in 1871, building on the earlier work of **Jean Bulliard**. The name likely derives from Greek roots _hebe_ ("youth") and _loma_ ("fringe" or "border"), possibly referencing the delicate veil remnants often found on young fruiting bodies. _Hebeloma_ is renowned for its diversity, ecological importance, and role in mycorrhizal partnerships.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Hebeloma** species are moderately sized, often appearing inconspicuous but important:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to broadly umbonate, smooth to slightly fibrillose or sticky.
  - Colors range from pale tan to brownish, sometimes with darker centers.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to sinuate) and brownish pink to cinnamon-colored at maturity.
  - Stipes are slender to stout, typically with no prominent ring.
  - Spore prints are brown to clay-colored.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, producing four spores.
  - Spores are almond-shaped, smooth to roughened, often with distinctive warts or dots.
  - Cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia are prominent and critical for species identification.

**Synapomorphies** include brown spore prints, farinaceous (mealy) odor, and ornamented spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Hebeloma** firmly within Hymenogastraceae, closely related to _Galerina_, _Psilocybe_, and _Gymnopilus_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Hymenogastraceae
 ├── Hebeloma
 ├── Galerina
 ├── Gymnopilus
 ├── Psilocybe
 └── Hymenogaster
```
The genus likely radiated during the early to mid-Cenozoic, closely tracking the spread of ectomycorrhizal trees and shrubs.

Important species include:

- _Hebeloma crustuliniforme_ ("poison pie")
- _Hebeloma sacchariolens_
- _Hebeloma mesophaeum_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests (coniferous and hardwood), grasslands, heathlands, mossy ground, and tundra.
- **Substrates:** Soil, particularly near living roots of trees and shrubs.
- **Trophic modes:** Primarily ectomycorrhizal, forming mutualistic associations; some species are saprotrophic.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread across boreal, temperate, and alpine ecosystems.

Many species are adapted to cold climates and poor soils, making them important in early successional stages.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Hebeloma** fungi are ecologically critical but have limited culinary value:

- **Edibility and toxicity:**
  - Many species are considered mildly toxic or cause gastrointestinal distress (_Hebeloma crustuliniforme_ being notorious).
  - General advice is to avoid eating _Hebeloma_ unless expertly identified and verified as safe.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important partners for ectomycorrhizal trees, aiding in nutrient acquisition and drought resistance.
  - Key components of soil fungal communities in nutrient-poor or disturbed habitats.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Used in ecological studies of plant-fungal symbioses, particularly in harsh environments like tundra and high-altitude forests.

Though often overlooked, _Hebeloma_ plays a vital role in supporting forest and grassland ecosystems around the world.
