## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Phaeocollybia festiva_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) Rolf Singer, 1939  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Deeply rooting stipes, rusty-brown spore prints, conical to bell-shaped caps, ectomycorrhizal  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Phaeocollybia** was formally established by **Rolf Singer** in 1939, refining earlier classifications by **Elias Magnus Fries**. The name combines Greek _phaeo-_ ("dusky" or "dark") and _collybia_ (an older fungal genus name), highlighting the brownish coloration typical of these mushrooms. Molecular studies have confirmed _Phaeocollybia_ as part of Hymenogastraceae, allied with gilled fungi like _Hebeloma_ and _Gymnopilus_.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Phaeocollybia** species have several distinctive field features:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are usually conical to bell-shaped, sometimes slightly umbonate, often moist or viscid.
  - Stipes are notably long, slender, deeply rooting (extending into soil or humus layers like a "taproot").
  - Coloration is generally brown, reddish-brown, or ochre.
  - Spore print is rusty-brown to reddish-brown.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, producing four spores.
  - Spores are smooth to finely roughened, ellipsoid to almond-shaped, and brown at maturity.
  - Clamp connections are present in many species.

**Synapomorphies** include deeply rooting stipes, rusty-brown spore prints, and the brownish hues of fruitbodies.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) support **Phaeocollybia** as a distinct genus within Hymenogastraceae, closely related to _Hebeloma_ and other brown-spored forest fungi.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Hymenogastraceae
 ├── Hebeloma
 ├── Gymnopilus
 ├── Galerina
 └── Phaeocollybia
```
The genus likely diversified with the expansion of ectomycorrhizal forest ecosystems in the late Cretaceous and Cenozoic.

Important species include:

- _Phaeocollybia festiva_
- _Phaeocollybia kauffmanii_
- _Phaeocollybia christinae_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist coniferous and mixed forests, mossy soils, and humus-rich areas.
- **Substrates:** Soil, usually near living tree roots.
- **Trophic modes:** Obligate ectomycorrhizal, forming mutualistic relationships with forest trees (especially conifers like firs, spruces, and pines).

- **Geographic range:** Primarily distributed in temperate zones, including North America, Europe, and parts of East Asia.

Some species are associated with old-growth forests and are sensitive to habitat disturbance.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Phaeocollybia** fungi are important for forest health but are little used otherwise:

- **Edibility:**
  - Generally considered inedible due to tough, fibrous texture and small culinary interest.
  - Some species are poorly studied toxicologically.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important symbionts for forest trees, aiding in nutrient and water acquisition.
  - Indicators of stable, undisturbed forest ecosystems.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Some species are considered vulnerable or rare, especially in regions where old-growth forests are threatened.

The hidden, rooting nature of _Phaeocollybia_ fruitbodies underscores their deep ecological integration into the forest soil ecosystem.
