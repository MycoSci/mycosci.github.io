## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Fistulina hepatica_  
* **Authority & year:** Bull. (Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard), 1791  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Tongue- to bracket-shaped fleshy fruiting bodies, reddish-brown coloration, poroid hymenophore, bleeding reddish juice when cut  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Fistulina** was formally described by **Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard** in 1791. The name is derived from the Latin _fistula_ ("pipe" or "tube"), referring to the microscopic tubular structures of the hymenium. _Fistulina_ is one of the few poroid genera traditionally associated with fleshy, non-woody fungi rather than classic tough polypores.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Fistulina** species, though few, are highly distinctive:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are tongue-shaped, bracket-like, or flattened, thick and fleshy.
  - Color is reddish-brown, resembling raw meat.
  - Fresh flesh exudes a reddish juice when cut.
  - Hymenium is poroid (bearing small separate tubes) but fleshy and soft when young.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are typical club-shaped, producing four spores externally.
  - Spores are smooth, ellipsoid, hyaline to pale yellowish.
  - Tubes of the hymenophore are discrete (unfused), unlike most polypores.

**Synapomorphies** include fleshy, reddish brackets with discrete pores and reddish juice exudation.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) confirm **Fistulina** as a distinct lineage within **Fistulinaceae** and closely allied to basal lineages of Agaricales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Fistulinaceae
 └── Fistulina
```
The genus likely represents an early-diverging evolutionary experiment with poroid structures, independent of the true polypores of Polyporales.

Key species:

- _Fistulina hepatica_ (beefsteak fungus)

Other minor or regionally recognized species (_Fistulina antarctica_, etc.) exist but are far less common.

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Deciduous forests, mature hardwood stands (especially oak and chestnut).
- **Substrates:** Living trees (as a weak parasite) and dead wood.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic and parasitic — slowly decaying heartwood and causing brown rot.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed in temperate zones of Europe, North America, Asia, and Australasia.

_Fistulina hepatica_ is a hallmark species of old, open-grown oaks and chestnut forests.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Fistulina** fungi are notable for their culinary and ecological roles:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Fistulina hepatica_ is edible when young and is prized in some regions for its meaty texture and sour, tangy flavor.
  - Often used as a meat substitute, grilled, or marinated.

- **Ecological impact:**
  - Plays a role in tree aging and hollowing processes, creating habitats for cavity-nesting birds and insects.

- **Cultural significance:**
  - Sometimes called "beefsteak fungus" due to its strong resemblance to slices of raw beef.

Its strange appearance, culinary use, and role in forest ecosystems have earned _Fistulina_ an enduring place in naturalist lore.
