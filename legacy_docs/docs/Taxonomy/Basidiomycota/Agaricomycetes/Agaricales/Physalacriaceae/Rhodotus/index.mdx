## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Rhodotus palmatus_  
* **Authority & year:** Maire, 1926  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Medium-sized mushrooms, wrinkled or net-like caps, pinkish hues, decurrent gills, white spore prints  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Rhodotus** was formally described by **René Maire** in 1926. The name derives from Greek _rhodon_ ("rose" or "pink") and _otos_ ("ear"), likely referring to the distinctive pinkish color and the sometimes ear-like shape of the cap margin. _Rhodotus_ is a highly distinctive and monotypic genus (containing a single recognized species).

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Rhodotus** species (essentially _Rhodotus palmatus_) have striking and unique characteristics:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flattened, pinkish to salmon-colored, with a prominent wrinkled or reticulate (netted) surface texture.
  - The surface is gelatinous or sticky when moist, giving it a translucent appearance.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to slightly decurrent), crowded, and whitish to pinkish.
  - Stipes are centrally attached, thick, often colored like the cap.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and broadly ellipsoid to nearly globose.
  - Clamp connections are present.

**Synapomorphies** include the unique wrinkled, gelatinous pinkish cap, white spore print, and wood-dwelling habit.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) position **Rhodotus** within Physalacriaceae, allied with genera like _Flammulina_, _Armillaria_, and _Oudemansiella_, although it remains morphologically unique among its relatives.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

 └── Rhodotus
```
The genus likely represents a specialized lineage adapted to wood decay in specific climatic and ecological niches.

Key species:

- _Rhodotus palmatus_ (the only recognized species)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Deciduous forests, especially in damp, shaded environments with rich organic debris.
- **Substrates:** Fallen logs, rotting hardwood (especially elm), decaying stumps.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, specializing in decomposing lignified plant material.

- **Geographic range:** Native to Europe, North America, and parts of Asia; relatively rare and considered threatened in some regions due to loss of old-growth forests and habitat degradation.

Species fruits typically in late summer to autumn after periods of heavy rainfall.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Rhodotus** fungi are rare but visually iconic:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Rhodotus palmatus_ is not considered edible due to its gelatinous texture and limited flesh, though it is not known to be toxic.

- **Conservation status:**
  - Regarded as near-threatened or vulnerable in parts of Europe due to sensitivity to air pollution, forest management practices, and the decline of suitable deadwood habitats.

- **Scientific and aesthetic importance:**
  - Their unique appearance makes _Rhodotus_ a subject of interest for photographers, naturalists, and mycologists.
  - Serve as an example of fungal specialization and ecological dependency on old-growth forest ecosystems.

Their rare beauty and ecological significance emphasize the importance of preserving natural forest habitats rich in deadwood.
