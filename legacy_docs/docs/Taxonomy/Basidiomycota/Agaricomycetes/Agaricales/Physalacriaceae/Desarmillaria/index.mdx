# Desarmillaria <Badge variant="note" text="Genus" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Physalacriaceae › **Genus:** Desarmillaria

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Desarmillaria tabescens_  
* **Authority & year:** R.A. Koch & Aime, 2017  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Honey-colored mushrooms, absence of a true ring (annulus), wood-inhabiting, white spore prints, saprotrophic or weakly pathogenic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Desarmillaria** was formally described by **Robert A. Koch** and **Catriona A. Aime** in 2017 following molecular studies that separated these species from _Armillaria_. The name _Desarmillaria_ means "without Armillaria," reflecting the lack of a true annulus (ring) on the stipe, a key difference from traditional honey mushrooms.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Desarmillaria** species are outwardly similar to _Armillaria_ but have distinctive traits:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flattened, honey-yellow to tan, sometimes slightly scaly.
  - Gills are attached (adnate to slightly decurrent), crowded, pale cream to yellowish.
  - Stipes are central, tough, lacking a persistent ring (no armilla).
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid.
  - Clamp connections are present in hyphae.

**Synapomorphies** include honey-colored fruitbodies, lack of an annulus, and white spores.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, tef1) reveal **Desarmillaria** as a sister lineage to _Armillaria_ within Physalacriaceae, having diverged as a distinct evolutionary unit specializing in similar ecological niches but morphologically differentiated by the absence of a veil.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Physalacriaceae
 ├── Armillaria
 ├── Desarmillaria

 └── Oudemansiella
```
_Desarmillaria_ likely evolved from _Armillaria_-like ancestors, adapting toward a morphology without a persistent ring, perhaps linked to different ecological pressures or life strategies.

Important species:

- _Desarmillaria tabescens_ (ringless honey mushroom)
- _Desarmillaria ectypa_ (marsh-loving species)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Forests, woodlands, near dead roots and stumps, moist environments.
- **Substrates:** Dead or dying hardwoods, buried roots, sometimes living tree bases.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic and weakly pathogenic (causing limited root decay).

- **Geographic range:** Primarily in North America and Europe, especially in warm-temperate zones.

Species typically fruit in late summer to autumn, often forming dense, overlapping clusters.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Desarmillaria** fungi are ecologically important and culturally notable:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Desarmillaria tabescens_ is considered edible after thorough cooking, though texture and flavor can be variable.
  - Proper identification is crucial to avoid confusion with toxic lookalikes.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Important decomposers of hardwood in temperate forests.
  - Less aggressive pathogens compared to _Armillaria_, but can still contribute to tree decline in stressed forests.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Their distinction from _Armillaria_ refines understanding of root rot ecology and fungal evolution.

While smaller in ecological footprint than _Armillaria_, _Desarmillaria_ species are important members of forest fungal communities.
