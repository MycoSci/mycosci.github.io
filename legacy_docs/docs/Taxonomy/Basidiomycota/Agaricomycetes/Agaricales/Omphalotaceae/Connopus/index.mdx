## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Connopus acervatus_  
* **Authority & year:** R.H. Petersen, 2010  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small wood-inhabiting mushrooms, central stipe, brownish caps, white spore prints, saprotrophic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Connopus** was established by **Ronald H. Petersen** in 2010, based on molecular evidence that separated it from traditional _Gymnopus_-like groupings. The name _Connopus_ combines Latin _connexus_ ("joined" or "connected") and _pus_ ("foot" or "stem"), referring to the robust connection between the stipe and substrate, distinguishing these mushrooms from others in Omphalotaceae.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Connopus** species show a blend of traits between wood-inhabiting and soil fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are convex to flat, dry, smooth to slightly fibrillose, often brownish to tan.
  - Gills are adnate to adnexed, closely spaced, and pale in color.
  - Stipes are central, slender to moderately stout, tough, and often dark at the base.
  - Spore prints are white.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, typically four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, and ellipsoid.
  - Cheilocystidia are present and important for species-level diagnosis.

**Synapomorphies** include white spore prints, wood-associated habit, and tough-stemmed small mushrooms with brown caps.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) position **Connopus** within Omphalotaceae, sister to genera like _Omphalotus_ and _Collybiopsis_ but distinct based on both morphology and DNA sequences.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Omphalotaceae
 ├── Omphalotus
 ├── Collybiopsis
 └── Connopus
```
The genus likely represents an evolutionary specialization for robust fruiting on woody debris in shaded forest environments.

Important species:

- _Connopus acervatus_ (clustered toughshank)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Fallen logs, dead wood, woody debris in forests, woodland margins, and occasionally heavily decayed stumps.
- **Substrates:** Primarily hardwoods but occasionally softwoods.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, breaking down dead woody material.

- **Geographic range:** Primarily North America and Europe; possibly underreported elsewhere.

Fruiting often occurs in dense clusters after rainy periods, especially in late summer and autumn.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Connopus** fungi are of minor culinary or cultural importance but play key ecological roles:

- **Edibility:**
  - _Connopus acervatus_ is technically edible but considered tough and of low culinary value.
  - Their small size and fibrous texture make them unappealing for consumption.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important decomposers in forest ecosystems, accelerating the breakdown of woody material.
  - Contribute to nutrient cycling and forest floor health.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Part of the effort to revise and understand small, tough-stemmed, wood-inhabiting fungi molecularly separated from _Gymnopus_ and _Marasmius_ lineages.

Their overlooked role as decomposers emphasizes the ecological significance of even the humblest forest mushrooms.
