## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Omphalotus olearius_  
* **Authority & year:** Fayod, 1889  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Large, bright orange or brown funnel-shaped mushrooms, decurrent gills, bioluminescent tissues, white spore prints, toxic  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Omphalotus** was established by **Victor Fayod** in 1889 to separate species with deeply depressed (navel-like) caps from similar gilled mushrooms. The name derives from Greek _omphalos_ ("navel") and _otus_ ("ear"), describing the characteristic central depression and somewhat ear-shaped or funnel-like form.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Omphalotus** species are visually striking and structurally robust:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Caps are medium to large, brightly colored (typically orange, yellow, brown, or purple), often depressed in the center.
  - Gills are decurrent, radiating down the stipe, and may glow faintly in the dark (bioluminescence).
  - Stipes are stout, central to slightly off-center, tough.
  - Spore prints are white to pale cream.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, four-spored.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to slightly oblong.
  - Clamp connections are present in hyphae.

**Synapomorphies** include brightly colored, funnel-shaped fruitbodies with white spores and bioluminescent properties in some tissues.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, RPB2) place **Omphalotus** as the core genus of Omphalotaceae, distinct from superficially similar genera like _Clitocybe_ or _Pleurotus_.

The genus diversified alongside hardwood-dominated forests during the Cenozoic, specializing in saprotrophic decomposition of wood.

Important species include:

- _Omphalotus olearius_ (jack-o'-lantern mushroom, Europe)
- _Omphalotus illudens_ (jack-o'-lantern mushroom, North America)
- _Omphalotus nidiformis_ (ghost fungus, Australia, bioluminescent)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Decaying hardwood stumps, buried roots, fallen logs, and living tree bases.
- **Substrates:** Dead or dying wood, sometimes causing white rot.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing lignified plant material.

- **Geographic range:** Widely distributed across temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions — especially in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia.

Species usually fruit in dense, overlapping clusters in warm, humid conditions.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Omphalotus** fungi are culturally famous but toxic:

- **Toxicity:**
  - All species are poisonous, containing sesquiterpenes (e.g., illudin compounds) that cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms.
  - Misidentification with edible chanterelles (_Cantharellus_) can lead to dangerous poisoning.

- **Bioluminescence:**
  - Some species (_O. nidiformis_, _O. olearius_) are weakly bioluminescent, glowing with a greenish light visible in darkness.
  - Bioluminescence likely evolved to attract spore-dispersing insects, although exact ecological functions remain under investigation.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Key decomposers in forest ecosystems, accelerating wood decay and nutrient cycling.

- **Cultural relevance:**
  - Featured in folklore and mythology, often associated with ghostly lights or supernatural phenomena.

Their eerie glow and danger to the unwary make _Omphalotus_ one of the most fascinating and visually spectacular fungal genera.
