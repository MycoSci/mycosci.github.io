**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Agaricomycetes › **Order:** Agaricales › **Family:** Clavariaceae › **Genus:** Ramariopsis

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Ramariopsis kunzei_  
* **Authority & year:** (Fries) Corner, 1950  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Small delicate coral fungi, finely branched, white to pastel colors, smooth spores, white spore prints  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Ramariopsis** was established by **E. J. H. Corner** in 1950 during his comprehensive monograph on coral fungi. The name means "resembling _Ramaria_," as _Ramariopsis_ includes small, delicate corals distinct from the larger and often rough-spored _Ramaria_ species. Molecular studies have since confirmed _Ramariopsis_ as a key genus within Clavariaceae.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Ramariopsis** species are delicate and elegant members of the fungal world:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are small to medium, branched coral-like structures.
  - Surfaces are smooth (never rough or spiny).
  - Colors are often pale: white, cream, pastel yellow, pinkish, or faintly lilac.
  - Flesh is brittle and snaps cleanly.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are club-shaped, bearing four spores externally.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to globose, non-amyloid or weakly amyloid.
  - Clamp connections may or may not be present.

**Synapomorphies** include delicate, branched coralloid forms and smooth hyaline spores with white spore prints.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) place **Ramariopsis** clearly within Clavariaceae, distinct from _Clavulinopsis_ and _Clavaria_.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Clavariaceae
 ├── Clavaria
 ├── Clavulinopsis
 ├── Ramariopsis
 └── Hirticlavula
```
The genus likely diversified alongside the development of grasslands and mossy forest floors during the early Cenozoic.

Important species include:

- _Ramariopsis kunzei_ (white coral)
- _Ramariopsis subtilis_
- _Ramariopsis tenuiramosa_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist grasslands, forest edges, heathlands, mossy soils.
- **Substrates:** Soil, leaf litter, moss beds.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing plant debris and soil organic matter.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions.

They are often among the most abundant small corals in semi-natural and old-growth grassland ecosystems.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Ramariopsis** fungi are ecologically important but little utilized:

- **Edibility:**
  - Most species are considered inedible due to their small size and fragility, though not toxic.
  - Sometimes collected for decorative purposes by enthusiasts.

- **Ecological significance:**
  - Act as key decomposers in soil ecosystems.
  - Serve as indicators of high-quality, low-nutrient grasslands and ancient meadows.

- **Conservation relevance:**
  - Featured in fungal conservation efforts due to their sensitivity to habitat disturbance, nitrogen enrichment, and agricultural intensification.

Their fine structure and soft pastel colors make _Ramariopsis_ species favorites for fungal photographers and biodiversity surveys.
