## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Genus  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Dacrymyces stillatus_  
* **Authority & year:** Nees, 1816  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Bright yellow-orange gelatinous fungi, cushion-shaped or lobed, tuning fork basidia, saprotrophic on wood  

## Discovery & Naming
The genus **Dacrymyces** was described by **Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck** in 1816. The name comes from the Greek _dakryon_ ("tear"), referencing the small, droplet-like shape of the fruitbodies, which often appear as bright beads on wood.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Dacrymyces** species are the classic "yellow wood jellies" of moist forests:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are gelatinous to rubbery, cushion-shaped, lobed, cerebriform (brain-like), or disc-shaped.
  - Colors are typically bright yellow to deep orange, rarely paler or whitish.
  - Surfaces are smooth, wrinkled, or slightly lobed.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are bifurcate ("tuning fork"-shaped), splitting into two spore-bearing arms.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include gelatinous textures, bright yellow-orange colors, and distinctive tuning fork basidia.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU) firmly place **Dacrymyces** at the center of the Dacrymycetaceae family within the Dacrymycetales. It is evolutionarily distinct from other jelly fungi like Tremellales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**
```
Dacrymycetaceae
 └── Dacrymyces
```
The genus likely represents ancient adaptations for moist, wood-based decomposition.

Important species include:

- _Dacrymyces stillatus_ (common orange jelly)
- _Dacrymyces capitatus_

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Decaying wood, including fallen logs, stumps, and large branches; often favoring damp, shaded environments.
- **Substrates:** Dead hardwoods and conifers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, decomposing wood through white rot mechanisms.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; found in temperate, tropical, and boreal forests worldwide.

Species often fruit prolifically after rain and during humid seasons.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Dacrymyces** fungi are small but crucial parts of forest ecosystems:

- **Edibility:**
  - Not typically consumed — fruitbodies are gelatinous, small, and insubstantial.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Early decomposers of wood, softening it for further colonization by insects, bacteria, and other fungi.
  - Accelerate nutrient recycling in forest ecosystems.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Important models for studying the evolution of bifurcate basidia and early wood-decaying fungi.

Their bright colors, jelly textures, and vital early-stage decay roles make _Dacrymyces_ one of the most charming and important genera of forest fungi.
