# Dacrymycetaceae <Badge variant="note" text="Family" />

**Taxonomic hierarchy:** **Phylum:** Basidiomycota › **Class:** Dacrymycetes › **Order:** Dacrymycetales › **Family:** Dacrymycetaceae

---

## Quick ID
* **Rank:** Family  
* **Type species (if applicable):** _Dacrymyces stillatus_ (for the type genus _Dacrymyces_)  
* **Authority & year:** Chevall., 1826  
* **Diagnostic keywords:** Bright yellow-orange gelatinous fungi, tuning fork basidia, saprotrophic on decaying wood  

## Discovery & Naming
The family **Dacrymycetaceae** was established by **François Fulgis Chevallier** in 1826. It includes the bright, gelatinous fungi that were among the first recognized as distinct from more typical, fleshy basidiomycetes. The name derives from _Dacrymyces_, meaning "tear fungus," referring to their small, droplet-like fruitbodies.

## Morphology & Diagnostics
**Dacrymycetaceae** fungi are instantly recognizable among wood-inhabiting jelly fungi:

- **Macroscopic traits:**
  - Fruiting bodies are gelatinous, rubbery, or soft-waxy.
  - Growth forms include cushion-shaped blobs, lobed brain-like masses, and small discs.
  - Colors are vivid yellow, orange, or apricot, occasionally pale or whitish.
  - Surfaces are smooth, wrinkled, or irregular.

- **Microscopic traits:**
  - Basidia are bifurcate ("tuning fork"-shaped), unique among most basidiomycetes.
  - Spores are smooth, hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical.
  - Clamp connections are absent.

**Synapomorphies** include tuning fork basidia, gelatinous textures, and distinctive bright pigmentation.

## Phylogeny & Evolution
Molecular phylogenetic studies (ITS, LSU, SSU) place **Dacrymycetaceae** at the core of Dacrymycetales, distinct from other jelly fungi such as those in Tremellales.

**Simple text-based cladogram:**

The family represents an ancient and specialized lineage of wood-decomposing fungi.

Primary genera:

- _Dacrymyces_ (type genus)
- _Calocera_ (club-shaped jelly fungi)

## Ecology & Distribution
- **Habitat preferences:** Moist dead wood, especially fallen branches, logs, and stumps.
- **Substrates:** Primarily decaying hardwoods and conifers.
- **Trophic modes:** Saprotrophic, specializing in early-stage decomposition.

- **Geographic range:** Cosmopolitan; widespread in temperate, tropical, and boreal forests.

Species fruit abundantly during wet, humid conditions, and often disappear quickly when dried out.

## Cultural & Economic Notes
**Dacrymycetaceae** fungi are critical decomposers but have modest visibility:

- **Edibility:**
  - Generally not considered edible — fruitbodies are small, gelatinous, and of little culinary value.

- **Ecological importance:**
  - Important pioneers in wood decay, softening wood for colonization by later fungal species and invertebrates.
  - Accelerate nutrient cycling and organic matter breakdown in forest ecosystems.

- **Scientific relevance:**
  - Studied for their unusual basidial structure and evolutionary divergence among Basidiomycota.
  - Increasing interest in their potential ligninolytic (wood-decay) enzymes for biotechnological applications.

Their dazzling yellows, crucial decomposition roles, and ancient evolutionary position make _Dacrymycetaceae_ a quietly vital family in global forest ecosystems.
